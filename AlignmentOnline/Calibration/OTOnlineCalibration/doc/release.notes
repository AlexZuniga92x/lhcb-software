 - Fix race condition between start and analyse.
 - Listen to DIM service that exports LHCb clock phase.
 - Add option to switch on/off usage of LHCb clock phase.
 - Read T0 used in data from XML used by online Brunel.
 - Don't redo calibration if calibration we before created is not yet used.
 - Judgement to write new XML is done on (prevPhase + dataT0) - (phase + t0).
 - Final testing to be done.
 
! 2015-04-13 - Roel Aaij
 - Large update to calibration algorithm.
   - Anything that is not global T0 calibration has been removed.
   - Algorithm tested with FEST.
   - Correct XML is written.
   - Publish version in format expected by Clara.

! 2015-03-04 - Roel Aaij
 - Updates and fixes to run online. Configuration script and test script
   to launch additional log viewer.

! 2015-02-03 Lucia Grillo
- added boost v* in the requirements. 
- when a new global t0 has to be written a folder v(n_existing+1) is created 
  and inside a structure as in the db is created:
  /Conditions/OT/Calibration/CalibrationGlobal.xml

! 2015-02-02 Lucia Grillo
- getting the drift time residual distribution for each station from the EOR 
files (monitoring from Brunel: OTTrackMonitor)
- variable double globalt0_threshold default value = 0.1 (ns), otherwise 
to be specified. If |global_t0| > globalt0_threshold => xml file with the new
condition is writte.

! 2015-01-30 Lucia Grillo
- Flag to do only global t0 calibration; global t0 wrote in the xml format
designed by Wouter
- Default only global t0 calibration
reads global t0 from Wouter's database and writes xml file in the same format
- Added histog_2d_109.root and clbr_hists_109.root, examples input files with
monolayer alignment used. Note that at the moment the input global t0 histo is
actually the sum of the histos of the 3 stations. I will change this using an
example of monitoring .root file to give the right format.

! 2015-01-29 Lucia Grillo
- Version used for studies: 2d histo with FitSlicesY();
Lots of output: txt file for the offsets, all fits saved in rootfile,
global t0 calculated and module t0 calculated. 
Still to work on the format of the output xmls

! 2015-01-22 Lucia Grillo
- Different calculations of t0 per Module (4 contribution or single
contribution, fits or get mean); Added the global t0 computation. 
xml format to be finalized; "Monitoring" histograms: replaced the old ones
 with a simpler version. to be improved.
- Fix to the Save_Fits option; correction for m==8 (only 2 halfs monolayers)

! 2015-01-12 - Lucia Grillo
- Adding OTt0OnlineClbr for online calibration of t0
- First version: compiling, stil to be tested 

! 2015-01-12 - Roel Aaij
 - initial import
 - Add dependency on OMAlib
