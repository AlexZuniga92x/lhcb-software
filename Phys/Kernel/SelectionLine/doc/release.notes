! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Package     : Phys/SelectionLine
! Responsible : Gerhard Raven
! Purpose     : Infrastructure for HLT and stripping 'lines'
! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! 2014-12-04 - Gerhard Raven
 - further reduce overhead; 
   note: Hlt::Line and SelectionAlg again need to be updated accordingly!

! 2014-12-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - change signature of numberOfCandidates so that we can avoid filling 'all zeros'
   into TPRofile, which is not cheap. This change saves O(2%) of the CPU time in
   the HLT! Note that Hlt::Line and SelectionAlg need to be updated coherently.

! 2014-11-30 - Gerhard Raven
 - make Turbo a dedicated property, check for consistency with configured algorithms
 - use std::chrono instead of Gaudi time functions for timing measurments
 - remove unneeded check on TurboMIAB dummy algorithm

!========================= SelectionLine v1r2 2014-11-05 =========================

! 2014-11-04 - Sean Benson
 - Check for Turbo signature, if found set executionStage to 254.

! 2014-10-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - do NOT catch exceptions thrown by subalgorithms  
 - streamline creation of subalgorithms
 - C++11 cleanup

!========================= SelectionLine v1r1 2014-05-16 =========================

! 2014-04-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - Replace boost::array with std::array.
 - Put Stages in a std::unique_ptr instead of managing them explicitly.

! 2014-04-15 - Chris Jones
 - If a tool fails to initialize in Selection::Line::initialize(), pass this
   failure back to the application framework.
 - Delete the Stage objects in Selection::Line::~Line().

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p5 2013-07-08 =========================

! 2013-07-05 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Moved definition of static const double timeHistoLowBound from class declaration
   to unnamed namespace in order to fix compiler errors under gcc4.7/4.8

! 2013-07-05 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Switch units of elapsed time back to microSec (had been set to nanoSec)
   (caused every event to be marked as too slow, due to the factor of 1000)

! 2013-07-04 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Protect timing histograms against log(dt=0) entries.
   If the line finishes quicker than the timing resolution of the system call (1mus)
   then the lowest bin of the histo is filled. task #44041

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p4 2013-06-13 =========================

! 2013-05-14 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a few icc11 warnings from Selection::Line, plus a little tidy up.

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p3 2013-05-07 =========================

! 2013-02-27 - Chris Jones
 - Fix -pedantic compilation warnings

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p2 2012-11-30 =========================

! 2012-11-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

!======================= SelectionLine v1r0p1 2010-02-27 =====================

! 2010-02-27 - Gerhard Raven
 - shorten histogram names

!======================= SelectionLine v1r0 2010-01-29 =====================

! 2010-01-18 - Gerhard Raven
 - initial import of code adapted from Hlt/HltLine, together with 
   HltBase/HltHistogramUtilities (the latter is here for dependency reasons
   only, and should be moved 'further' down in the dependency stack)
 - reshuffle a bit.. (Line.{h,cpp} -> SelectionLine.{h,cpp}, move SelectionLine.h
   into Kernel)
