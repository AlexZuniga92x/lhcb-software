! Package     : Phys/Swimming
! Responsible : Vladimir Gligorov, Roel Aaij
! Purpose     : Scripts for swimming the HLT/Stripping/Offline selections
!               for lifetime measurements 
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2013-09-30 - Roel Aaij
 - Add some documentation explaining the deterministic nature of RandomSelector.

! 2013-09-27 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix swimming the stripping. Apparently something was going wrong with the
   types setup in Swimming.decorators; it looks like (Py)ROOT sometimes messes
   with the class table. As a workaround, the definitions have been moved into
   the eventloop, but are only called once.
 - Explicitely load SwimmingEventDict to get access to Swimming::hashParticle

! 2013-09-26 - V. Gligorov
 - Fix bug in SwimmingTisTos.py introduced by an earlier rollback
 - Make Configuration.py properly use either the __dev__ or normal DSTWriters
   depending on the avilability of the former
 - Update GeneralSetup to make it clear this is obsolete
 - Update SwimTriggerB2JpsiX.py, SwimStrippingB2JpsiX.py to be relevant 
   to testing Moore v14rX versions 

!========================= Swimming v3r0p1 2013-06-13 =========================

! 2013-05-13 - V. Gligorov (Added by CRJ as Vava forgot...)
 . Bug fix to something probably very important, but I don't know as no entry 
   was made...

!========================= Swimming v3r0 2013-04-05 =========================

! 2012-12-05 - V. Gligorov
 - Add scripts for correcting the VELO acceptance bug to the scripts directory,
   together with scripts to execute it on Stripping17 KK/KPi/PiPi ntuples.  
 - Correct bug in VELO acceptance calculation. This now takes into account the
   possibility of tertiary vertices, e.g. in B->DPi, D->3h.
 - Rewrite code which calculates the number of VELO hits on a track to take
   into account more details of the VELO geometry, for example tracks
   crossing the VELO halves, or tracks starting outside the VELO and going back in. 

!========================= Swimming v2r8p1 2012-11-30 =========================

! 2012-11-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

!========================= Swimming v2r8 2012-10-04 =========================

! 2012-07-23 - Nick Torr
 - Changed a few lines in EventLoop.py to deal with NULL pointers due to
	 event packing on DSTs from stripping 18 onwards
 - Removed .__dev__. DST writers as they are now obosolete
 - Removed "copyProtoParticles = True" option as this is also obsolete

!========================= Swimming v2r7 2012-07-06 =========================

! 2012-07-06 - Nick Torr
 - Fixed bug that caused problems swimming the KShh stripping lines

!========================= Swimming v2r6 2012-03-29 =========================

! 2012-03-20 - Roel Aaij
 - Re-enable output algorithms before exiting to allow correct finalisation.

! 2012-03-18 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix XML summary writing.
 - Disable FSRInputCopyStreamWriter when swimming the trigger

! 2012-03-12 - V. Gligorov
 - Change the setting of "EnableUnpack" to be compliant with the new software stack.

! 2012-03-08 - Roel Aaij
 - Open shelve database read only.

!========================= Swimming v2r5 2012-02-29 =========================

! 2012-02-17 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix tiny bug in event counting when running a set number of events; one too
   many was always processed.
 - Add a reference to the GlobalParams instance to the AppMgr to be able to
   call runSwimmingStep from top level GaudiPython.

! 2012-02-16 - Roel Aaij
 - Add configuration options for use in production to obtain the CondDB tag,
   DDDB tag and TCK from a database using the run number.
 - Add explicit import of EventNodeKiller to ConfigureMoore.

! 2012-02-07 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to changes in GaudiConf

!====================== Phys/Swimming v2r4p2 2011-12-20 =======================
! 2011-12-20 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix Swimming().OutputFile behaviour when swimming the stripping.
   The filename must be of the format prefix.somename.(m)dst. If prefix is 
   missing, it will be set to "Swimming"

!====================== Phys/Swimming v2r4p1 2011-12-07 =======================
! 2011-12-13 - V. Gligorov
 - Add fixes to Configuration.py for some trigger reconstruction steps which
   put their outputs in non-standard TES locations. Enable banks which need to
   be killed when rerunning the HLT to be passed as an argument, in case this
   fix does not catch all the misbehaving lines. 
 - Add more examples. 

! 2011-12-13 - Roel Aaij
 - Revert addition of multiple candidate swimming.

! 2011-12-12 - V. Gligorov

! 2011-12-12 - Roel Aaij
 - Allow adding additional locations to an MDST using the MuDSTCands property.

! 2011-12-09 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix the logic for importing the module containing the offline selection to
   allow it to be from an external package.

!====================== Phys/Swimming v2r4 2011-12-07 =======================
! 2011-12-08 - Roel Aaij
 - Add a printout string at the end of the event loop to print number of events
   processed.

! 2011-12-07 - Roel Aaij
 -  Fix bug in candidate matching return value, should use integer division to
    only get 1 in case of 100% matching.

! 2011-11-28 - Chris Jones
 - Add some additions CMT uses, to try and fix errors in the nightlies that
   could be due to undeclared dependencies...
 - Add a magic macro_depend line to also try and help fix the dependencies

! 2011-11-26 - Chris Jones
 - Rename the libraries libSwimmingFunctions.so and libSwimmingFunctionsDict.so
   to avoid any possible naming conflicts with other libraries (libFunctions.so 
   is too generic a name).

! 2011-11-21 - Frederic Dupertuis
 - Add multi-candidates swimming functionality (SelectMethod = "all") and
	 modified EventLoop and Configuration accordingly.
 - Remove explicit relations of daughter's tracks to TPs in EventLoop.

!====================== Phys/Swimming v2r3 2011-11-03 =======================

! 2011-11-14 - Roel Aaij

 - Add two new HLT transforms which do not forward upgrade all HLT1 tracks
   in all events, to save time in production.
 - Add new example scripts for swimming D2hh to the examples directory.  

! 2011-11-01 - Roel Aaij
 - Add WriteFSR property to steer the writing of FSRs in the output file.

 - Add example scripts for use with gaudirun.py to example
 - Small fix for odin check in RunSwimming.py

! 2011-10-20 - Roel Aaij
 - For a final refined turning point, the last interval is moved forward by half
   the final granularity to avoid a systematic downward bias (swimming is always
   left to right).
 - Use pprint to make debug more readable (but also more lines).
 - Add AppMgr.stop, finalize, exit at the end.

! 2011-10-19 - Roel Aaij
 - Fixed some HltDecLast fallout from a previous change.
 - And reverted the fix because an important aspect was overlooked.

! 2011-10-16 - Roel Aaij

   either a DST or a MicroDST.
 - Use hashParticle from SwimmingEvent to calculate a hash for an
   LHCb::Particle and use it to store the daughter information.

! 2011-10-12 - Roel Aaij
 - Change custom map.__call__ into more natural __setitem__

! 2011-10-11 - Roel Aaij
 - Many changes, mainly:
   . Use new event model classes to persist swimming result.
   . Update the way trigger results are passed around.
   . Write the swimming result to the MicroDST.
   . Add candidate selection possibility, currently deterministic random or
     the first candidate.
   . In case of non-trivial candidate selection, put the selected candidate 
     in a special location for swimming.

!============================== v2r1 07-09-2011 ===============================
! 2011-09-07 - V. Gligorov
 - Many small bugfixes and updates to the code.
   . Save decisions of all triggers if swimming more than one trigger at once
   . Save which tracks participated in which trigger decision
 - Write out muDST file at the end of swimming the stripping.     

!============================== v2r0 14-08-2011 ===============================
! 2011-08-14 - V. Gligorov
 - Update to 2011 data.
 - Includes the following changes :
   . Added code to get VELO geometric acceptance for each track at each
     turning point.
   . Added trigger tranformations for 2011 data.
   . Rewritten event loop which no longer needs to rewind events in order to swim
     them. Many thanks to Marco Clemencic and Gerhard Raven for hints and tips
     in this respect. The timing to swim a single event is now ~10s/event for HLT,
     ~4s/event for Stripping.

   TisTos code moved into its own script, SwimmingTisTos.py.
 - Added functionality to store information on how many of the final state
   tracks from the signal candidate were reconstructed in HLT1/2, and how
   many of these tracks were TOS with respect to the signal trigger in HLT1. 

!============================== v1r0 13-04-2011 ==============================

! 2011-04-13 - Vladimir Gligorov
  - First commit of the code which used to live in Hlt2CommissioningScripts.
    This has been broken up into several smaller scripts. 
    . RunSwimming   : is the main script which controls the event loop
    . RefineTPs     : controls the recursive refinement of the turning points
    . HltTransforms : contains the transformations which allow swimming from TCKs 
    . SwimmingUtils : contains miscallaneous helper functions
    . Globals       : contains a helper class to pass "globals" (e.g. the TES)
                      between the various modules
