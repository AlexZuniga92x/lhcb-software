! Package     : DaVinciTransporter
! Responsible : P. Koppenburg, Yuehong Xie

!========================== DaVinciTransporter v2r0 2005-01-18 ===================
! 2005-01-05 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/*.{cpp,h}
   . Interfaces moved from DaVinciTools to Kernel/
! 2004-12-16 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/*.{cpp,h}
   . Reflect the new interface IParticleTransporter (see DaVinciKernel)
   . Make them all GaudiTools
   . Remove all duplication of code (except accross tools)

!========================== DaVinciTransporter v1r2 2004-12-01 ===================
! 2004-11-08 - Yuehong Xie
 - src/ParabolicTransporter.cpp
   . Fix a bug in computing covariance matrix which affected the transort of Ks from magnetic 
     field to Velo region using CombinedTransporter due to a mistake in initialization.Note 
     CombinedTransporter doesn't uses linear transporter for neutral particles. 
   . The channel affected by this bug is Bd2Jpsiks.

!========================== DaVinciTransporter v1r1 2004-09-16 ===================
! 2004-08-25 - P. Koppenburg
 - cmt/requirements
   . Do not export header files

!========================== DaVinciTransporter v1r0 2004-08-24 ===================
! 2004-08-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - New package DaVinciTransporter extracted from DaVinciTools,
   containing all trasnporters
   
! 2004-08-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - Split DaVinciTools package into 
   . Phys/DaVinciKernel : DVAlgorithm, PhysDesktop and all Interfaces
   . Phys/ParticleMaker : All particle makers and the ParticleStuffer
   . Phys/DaVinciFilter : All Filter
   . Phys/VertexFit : All vertex fitters and the GeomDispCalculator.cpp
   . Phys/DaVinciTransporter : All transporters
   . Phys/DaVinciTools : Basically all high-level tools that are none
        of the abvove, f.i. DecayFinder, PreDV, CheckOverlap...    
   This split became necessary since DaVinciTools was become a huge monster
   containing unrelated stuff (what do the TrackTypeFilterCriterion and the 
   CombinedParticleMaker have in common?). Also DaVinciTools was evolving
   with all versions of DaVinci. In the short term, I hope that most 
   developments will affect DaVinciFilter, while the other packages will
   be rather stable except for bug fixes.
   
!========================== DaVinciTools v10r3 2004-08-23 ===================
! 2004-08-23 - Florence RANJARD
 - replace GaudiTools/ with GaudiAlg

!========================== DaVinciTools v10r0 2004-07-22 ===================
! 2004-07-22 - P. Koppenburg for Yuehong Xie
 - src/NsctVeloTransporter.cpp
 - src/TrTransporter.cpp
   . Problem found with impact parameter of a gamma converting to two electrons. 
     The problem was that I forgot to set the error of z to zero after all the 
     other elements of the error matrix are transform to a state with err_z=0. 
     It didn't cause any problem to vertex fitting, which doesn't use the error 
     of z at all, but led to failure in calculating impact parameter, for which 
     the error of z is used.

   . In NsctVeloTransporter.cpp I fixed two other problems:
     o checked charge of particles before adding multiple scattering error
     o for multiple scattering, added 3 missed correlation elements in the 
       error matrices.

    . Redefinition of error on z position for transport of composite particles.   
    This changes the chi^2 of vertices:
    . It is understood why chi2 is bigger after the change in transporter
      to take in to account the uncertainty in z of fitted vertex. The reason 
      is vx and vy are highly correlated with vz. If error of vz is neglected, 
      all the uncertainties are ascribed to errors of vx and vy. By transfroming
      this vertex to a fixed z with a linear assumption, the uncertainty in vx 
      and vy due to the uncertainty of vz is removed, so the errors of vx and 
      vy actually become smaller. Average vertex fit chi2 is thus increased. 
      This explains why the selection cuts are harder. It is possible that
      more bb events are rejected than signal events, becasue generally 
      speaking the uncertianty in z of a combinatorial vertex is bigger than 
      that of a true vertex. So I expect signal to background ratio won't be 
      worse than before if all chi2 cuts are relaxed a bit to achieve same 
      efficiencies as before.

! 2004-07-16 - P. Koppenburg for Yuehong Xie
  - src/LifetimeFitter.cpp
    . posMomCorr() was misused as the upper square in LifetimeFitter.cpp, 
      and this is fixed.
  - src/LinearTransporter.cpp
    . A transfromation is introduced in  LinearTransporter.cpp to account 
      for the z uncertainty of the initial state. It changes nothing when 
      the initial state is not from a fitted vertex and thus has no error 
      on z.
      The code for the linear transport of the covariance is also rewritten 
      to make it short and to fix the problem of two missing lines in the 
      old version
        newPosSlopesCorr(1,2) = oldPosSlopesCorr(1,2) + dz*oldSlopesMomErr(1,2);
        newPosSlopesCorr(2,1) = oldPosSlopesCorr(2,1) + dz*oldSlopesMomErr(2,1);
      This is not a complete fix to the initial covariance matrix problem.
      There are two things to be solved:
      *) charged particles like D+, Ds+
      *) if one use CombinedTransporter which uses extrapolators in the 
         Tr/TrExtrapolator package.

    ---
    >     log << MSG::DEBUG << " z is out of range, z < -500.0 or z > 21000.0"
