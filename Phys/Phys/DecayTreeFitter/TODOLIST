- why is the decay vertex stored separately in the event store. why not owned by the particle.

- protoparticle contains SmartRefs to daughters. that means daughters
need to be in a list. that means a vertex fit can never update
daughters.

- why does the Particle contain the vertex information and a reference
to an end vertex? I guess that this is not vertex info but actually a begin point for tracks


- move mass constraint to particle base such that it is also accessible to BtaComposite

- remove merged moved constraints, constraint ordering

- implement sparce matrix for projection matrix (because that's what hurts most)

- re-compute energy when settig mass constraint (for better linearization)

- change order of constraints such that we get useful chisquare for each leave

- match to MC truth to test algo


---------------------


- revise RecoPhoton such that it can deal with Klongs --> no energy constraint

- think about what happens to bremstrahlung: e+ -> e+ gamma

- implement sparse matrices

- make a head-of-tree class, that derives from InternalParticle and is
  base for InteractionPoint.

- make charged particles curve (now only done for charged tracks) -->
not difficult: need only change ParticleBase::filterGeoConstraint.


[- move 'getFitted' from VtkVertex into ParticleBase]
[- move 'p4WErr'    from VtkVertex into ParticleBase (remove 'momIndex' from BeamSpot)]
[- move projection of kinematic constraint into daughter]

Things that need to be changed in VtxFitter:

- my fit fails if you try to vertex a pi0 without further constraints

- you cannot see if a bta-composite has seen a mass constraint or not;
this is a problem for the fit
