  - FlavourTagging/INNetTool.h
  - FlavourTagging/ISecondaryVertexTool.h
    . Moved to DaVinciKernel

! 2005-07-04 - M. Musy
 - New version which exploits the new FlavourTag class definition
   in PhysEvent
 - BTagging has became BTaggingTool, while it remains for backward
   compatibility and as an example of how to use the tagging tool
 - BTaggingTool itself has been splitted in TaggerXXXTools which return
   the tagger candidates to BTaggingTool which eventually combines them
   into a final decision
 - SecondaryVertexTool has been splitted into 3 separate tools all
   inheriting from the same interface ISecondaryVertexTool which has been
   modified to return a vector of vertices instead of a single vertex
   A new SVertexABTool is created. It returns two vertices instead of
   just one, for the moment only for development purposes.

!========================== FlavourTagging v5r6 2005-05-30 ===================
! 2005-05-28 - M. Musy

    . Default is now without L0 L1 and Tampering; without Tampering, results
      may change (worsen) slightly depending upon the decay channel.
    . Code structure has been revised.
    . Bug on same-side pion tagger fixed.

! 2005-02-02 - P. Koppenburg for Marco Musy

  - options/CheatedSelection.opts
    . Removed DaVinciCommon and DaVinciReco already included in
      DVBTagging.opts

! 2005-01-31 - P. Koppenburg for Marco Musy
Main changes/upgrades are the following:

- tagging efficiencies and performance calculation are now moved
to BTaggingMonitor so that no truth information is accessed at any stage.

- BTagging.cpp still needs to rerun the trigger because it
makes use of the tampering info

- SecondaryVertex is now a tool, and the user can choose whether
to use the TDR definition or the revised version of it using
NeuralNets (default is old tdr)

- I implemented the new definition of tagging categories, obtained
by using a NNet tuned for each taggers separately.
these NNets are accessed via a tool (this was asked for in a meeting).
the user can still choose to stick to the old TDR categories via
BTagging.CombinationTechnique = "TDR";

- summaryof.cpp is an additional standalone program to quickly get
useful numbers out of the logfiles. it contains the instructions on
how to run it.

- DVBTagging.opts is meant as an example option file.

 - New version of tagging code to substitute what used for TDR.
   NOTE: Be CAREFULL to use the new (or old) tagging code after loose-cuts
         selections as this may imply that particles belonging
         to the signal are left as possible taggers, which spoils the tag!

   . use DaVinciTools v8r* and DaVinciMCTools v5r*
   . remove explicit use of DaVinciAssociators and TrAssociators (via
     DaVinciMCTools)
   . increase version numver to v4r4

!==================== FlavourTagging v4r3 2003-04-25 =====================
! 2003-04-10 - Olivier Dormond
 - Added a combined particle maker until one is available globally.
 - The FlavourTaggingAlgorithm now reports the statistical errors at the end
   of the job.
 - Added a tool to implement the same-side kaon tagging.
 - Added a simple algorithm to summarise all the generated tags for a B in
   one line.
 - Cleanup the options files.

!==================== FlavourTagging v4r2 2003-01-06 =====================
! 2003-01-06 - Florence Ranjard
 - requirements - use LHCb v11r5

! =================== FlavourTagging v4r1 2003-01-06 ======================
! 2002-12-20 - Gloria Corti
 - Remove explicit dependecy of EventKernel in requirements

! 2002-11-20 - Olivier Dormond
 - Restructured the option files (have a look in
   /afs/cern.ch/user/o/odie/public/DaVinciOptionsForTheTagging for a set of
   option files for DaVinci).
 - Added support for multiple-collision in the FlavourMonitorAlgorithm. Stats
   are now splitted by number of collisions.
 - Added check for the L0 trigger in FlavourTaggingAlgorithm.
 - Droped the ntuple from the SingleParticleTaggingTool.
 - Added a SingleParticleTaggingMonitor to study the job of the so-named tool.

! =================== FlavourTagging v4r0 2002-11-13 ======================
! 2002-11-13 - Gloria Corti
 - Use explicitely EventKernel v2r0 because of compilation error
 - Use new major versions of DaVinciTools (v7r*) and DaVinciMCTools (v4r*)

! =================== FlavourTagging v3r0 2002-10-30 ======================
! 2002-10-21 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce some missing std:: to compile on windows

! 2002-10-19 - Olivier Dormond
 - Fixed a typo which caused the error on the effective efficiency to be wrong.
 - Added three options files to do tagging with only one kind a particle (Kaon,
   muon, electron).

! 2002-09-20 - Olivier Dormond
 - requirement: added DaVinciMCTools v3r* for the monitoring.
 - FlavourTagging.opts: Changed particle maker to Charged and "All".
 -                      Changed measured Z cut to more closely match the VELO.
 -                      Added setting for the FlavourTaggingDebug algorithm.
 - FlavourTaggingAlgorithm: Added a property 'FirstOnly' (default to false)
     which will let the tagging only use the first B in each hypo location.
     The idea is to have a workaround for the strange behaviour of the
     SelectBs2mumu algo which produces n^2 identical Bs where n is the number
     of primary vertices.
 - SingleParticleTaggingTool: Fixed the removing of the B decay products from
     the event by comparing the ProtoParticles. It could be replaced by the
     CheckOverlap tool when commonly available.
 - Added a FlavourTaggingDebug algorithm which dumps the B and the event.

! 2002-09-13 - Gloria Corti
 - Remove use of PhysEvent, update version of use used packages to be
   consistent with DaVinci v6r0 and set version to v3r0

! =================== FlavourTagging v2r0 2002-09-10 ======================
! 2002-09-10 - Olivier Dormond
 - Monitor: Divided the statistics based on how well the B has been
            reconstructed.
 - Tagging: Added a consistency check.
 - SPTT:    Added the event and run number to the ntuple.
 - All:     Small code layout changes.

! 2002-09-06 - Olivier Dormond
 - Made a cleanup of the abort messages.
 - Fixed the handling of the vertices so the impact param cut realy works.

! 2002-09-05 - Olivier Dormond
 - Fixed computation and report of the statistics for tagging and monitoring
 - Added the missing writeRecord so the ntuples are realy filled in!
 - Stripped down the generated name for the ntuple by only using the last
   part of the tool name (the one after the rightmost dot).

! 2002-09-03 - Olivier Dormond
 - The "/Particles" part of the hypothesis locations is now added
   automatically if not present.
 - Added a check to avoid trying to tag particles without a bottom quark.

! 2002-09-03 - Olivier Dormond
 - Swapped the way particles and B hypothesis are setup. Now the PhysDesktop
   takes care of the particles and the B are handled seperatly.
 - Support multiple locations for the B.
 - The tools support both Particles and ParticleVector.
 - The tools can produce an ntuple for optimization.
 - The tools can save a FlavourTag for the monitoring only.
 - Added a FlavourMonitorAlgorithm to check the FlavourTag against the truth.

! 2002-07-18 - Gloria Corti
 - Increase version number to v2r0 and use DaVinciTools v5r*
