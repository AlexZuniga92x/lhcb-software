     * - p1 and p2 are based on the same track (pointer comparison)
     * - the tracks for p1 and p2 share more than a certain fraction of hits
     *   (in Velo and T stations seperately)
     * - p1 and p2 fall into the same @f$(dp,d\eta,d\phi)@f bin (for pairs of
     *   charged tracks, we check the difference in curvature d(q/p) instead)
     * - p1 and p2 essentially have the same slopes in the Velo
     * - p1 and p2 appear to come from a gamma conversion (gamma -> ee / µµ)

     * 			uncertainty
     * @param dppErr	if negative, use momentum uncertainty of particles,
     * 			else use dppErr as the relative momentum uncertainty
     * @param minSharedHitFraction

     * 			at least this fraction of shared hits (if the track
     * 			has either a Velo or a T station segment, this
     * 			threshold has to apply for both the track seen as a
