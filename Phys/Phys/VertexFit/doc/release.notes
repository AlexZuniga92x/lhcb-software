  - src/PVReFitter.h
    . New PV refit tool
    . refit a primary type vertex 
    . remove all tracks of a particle from PV and refit PV
    . the problem of Velo/veloBack track charge is fixed by using Q=sign(tx)

!========================== VertexFit v1r6 2005-05-12 ===================
! 2005-04-25 - P. Koppenburg for L. Fernandez
  - src/UnconstVertexFitter.cpp 
  - src/UnconstVertexFitter.h
    . Another modification for neutrals. New options      
      UseDaughters = true 
    . looks recursively for all final states (with origin) or long-lived daughters
      in the resonances' decay trees
    . all gammas(s) found in the descendants are re-evaluated at the vertex
    . does not refit vertex if only one composite and gamma(s)
    . for composites in the original list only decaying to gammas:
      Point on track, decay vertex, momentum are *not* changed
    . TEMPORARY fix: allow to fit only gammas, e.g. pi0 -> gamma gamma. This should not be allowed

! 2005-04-21 - Yuehong Xie
  - introduce new tool src/NewDirectionFitter.cpp(.h)
    .a upgraded version of LifetimeFitter. The difference is this tool fits
     for both time and mass at the same time. Correlation between time and
     mass is obtained. Based on this a mass constraint can then be applied 
  - src/KFFitTool.cpp
    . update vertex chi2 and NDoF when reFitting a Particle

!========================== VertexFit v1r5p1 2005-04-20 ===================
! 2005-04-14 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/LagrangeGeomVertexFitter.cpp
  - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.cpp
    . Removed unused and obsolete #include "Kernel/CLHEPStreams.h"
!========================== VertexFit v1r5 2005-03-03 ===================
! 2005-02-28 - Hugo Ruiz

      distance of approach between tracks

! 2005-02-25 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/GeomDispCalculator.{cpp,h}
  - src/LagrangeGeomVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
  - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . Because of yet another bug of the new CLHEP 1.9, whenever one includes
      HepSymMatrix.h *after* *Point*.h, one does not get the mtheod
      00214    HepSymMatrix sub(int min_row, int max_row);
      which results in the run-trime error
      relocation error: .../slc3_ia32_gcc323/lib*.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5CLHEP12HepSymMatrix3subEii
    -> Include HepSymMatrix at the very beginning of the file.
    
! 2005-02-24 - P. Koppenburg for Hugo Ruiz
  - src/TrgVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . Do not fix vector sizes
! 2005-02-21 - P. Koppenburg for Hugo Ruiz

    . Fixes for resonant states and photons.
!========================== VertexFit v1r4 2005-02-22 ===================
! 2005-02-22 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/TrgVertexFitter.cpp
    . Windows does not know what to do with
         const int n = someVector.size() ;
	 double X[n] ;
      Use std::vectors throughout	 

! 2005-02-09 - P. Koppenburg

  - src/KFFitTool.h
  - src/LifetimeFitter.cpp
  - src/LifetimeFitter.h
  - src/TrgDispCalculator.cpp
    . Adapt to the plain stupid new structure of CLHEP 1.9, ensuring
      backward compatibility (hence no forward declarations). One cannot
      mix Vectors and Points in formulae anymore. One cannot easily convert
      one to the others. :-(
    . Make them GaudiTools where not already done.
    . Fix a few compilation warnings.

! 2005-02-08 - P. Koppenburg for Hugo Ruiz
  - src/TrgVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . New version that accepts intermediate states. Works fine with
      short-lived resonances but not yet well with long-lived like D0.
  - src/TrgDispCalculator.{cpp,h}
    . New tool that performs the job of the GeomDispCalculator
      and uses the sames assumptions as the TRgVertexFitter. Gets identical
      results under these assumptions.
  
! 2005-02-04 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/TrgVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . Fast Unconstrained Vertex Fitter by Hugo Ruiz.
      Works only with Particles made from TrgTracks. Assumes cylindrical 
      errors around the trajectory.
  - src/VertexFitter_load.cpp
    . Use it.
  - src/UnconstVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . Make it a little more readable

!========================== VertexFit v1r3 2005-01-18 ===================
! 2005-01-06 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/*.h
    . Moved all interface to $DAVINCIKERNELROOT/Kernel/
    
! 2004-12-15 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/UnconstVertexFitter.cpp
    . Initialize GaudiTool
! 2004-12-14 - P. Koppenburg for Luis Fernandez
  - src/UnconstVertexFitter.*
    . Add the possibility to treat photons correctly
    . Make it a GaudiTool
    -> yet to be tested
  
!========================== VertexFit v1r2 2004-12-01 ===================
! 2004-11-25 - Yuehong Xie
  - Modified KFFitTool.cpp/.h to make it work with Ks

! 2004-11-04 - Yuehong Xie
 - New tool KFFitTool.cpp/.h basically does
  . recomputation of track covariance matrix to fix a bug in Particle class
  . vertex fitting with Kalman Filter method
  . mass constraint of narrow width resonant particles 
  . adding photon or photon pair to a vertex and giving correct covariance matrix 
  . At the moment Kshort is not reprocessed. 
 - LagrangeDirectionFitter.cpp/.h
  . Add new method fitWithDirection which returns the modified primary vertex
  . Now Direction fitter and LifetimeFitter give very similar result
 - LifetimeFitter.cpp
  . Always check if matrix inversion is successful or not


!========================== VertexFit v1r1 2004-09-16 ===================
! 2004-08-25 - P. Koppenburg
 - cmt/requirements
   . Do not export header files

!========================== VertexFit v1r0 2004-08-24 ===================
! 2004-08-24 - P. Koppenburg
 - Made a mistake while importing DaVinciFilter, overwriting VertexFit. 
   Had to remove all filters from VertexFit.

! 2004-08-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - New package VertexFit extracted from DaVinciTools,
   containing all vertex fitters and assocaited tools.

! 2004-08-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - Split DaVinciTools package into 
   . Phys/DaVinciKernel : DVAlgorithm, PhysDesktop and all Interfaces
   . Phys/ParticleMaker : All particle makers and the ParticleStuffer
   . Phys/DaVinciFilter : All Filter
   . Phys/VertexFit : All vertex fitters and the GeomDispCalculator.cpp
   . Phys/DaVinciTransporter : All transporters
   . Phys/DaVinciTools : Basically all high-level tools that are none
        of the abvove, f.i. DecayFinder, PreDV, CheckOverlap...    
   This split became necessary since DaVinciTools was become a huge monster
   containing unrelated stuff (what do the TrackTypeFilterCriterion and the 
   CombinedParticleMaker have in common?). Also DaVinciTools was evolving
   with all versions of DaVinci. In the short term, I hope that most 
   developments will affect DaVinciFilter, while the other packages will
   be rather stable except for bug fixes.
   
!========================== DaVinciTools v10r3 2004-08-23 ===================
! 2004-08-23 - Florence RANJARD
 - replace GaudiTools/ with GaudiAlg

!========================== DaVinciTools v10r0 2004-07-22 ===================
! 2004-07-20 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.cpp
    . Bug affecting only Windows
      -> put definitions
         Particle* part3 = pList[2];
         Particle* part4 = pList[3];
      in the sections where one knows that there are more than 2 particles.

  - src/LifetimeFitter.cpp
    . posMomCorr() was misused as the upper square in LifetimeFitter.cpp, 
      and this is fixed.
!========================= DaVinciTools v9r5 2004-06-04 ===================
! 2004-06-04 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/LagrangeGeomVertexFitter.cpp
    . String over two lines corrected for Windows
    
! 2004-05-11 - P. Koppenburg for Claudia Pereira Nunes
 - src/LagrangeGeomVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
 - DaVinciTools/IGeomVertexFitter.h
   . New constrained vertex fitting tool. This tool has two public methods. 
     One, called fitWithGeom, makes only a geometrical  constrained fit for 
     at most 4 tracks. It doesn't make any kind of invariant mass vertex fit, 
     like the LagrangeMassVertexFitter tool does, it just constrain the
     particles to come from the same point. The other method, called 
     fitWithGeomAndSubMass, makes a geometrical constrained fit and an 
     invariant mass constrained fit of any daughter which is a resonance 
     (with width < 10 MeV).  This method only works if there is a daughter 
     resonance and it works for at most 4 tracks also. 
 - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
   . Corrected an error on the way the geometrical constrained 
     equations were being obtained.

!========================== DaVinciTools v9r2 2004-03-31 ==================
! 2004-03-30 - P. Koppenburg for Miriam Gandelman

   . Bug fix
  
!========================== DaVinciTools v8r4 2004-01-29 ==================
! 2004-01-14 - Gloria CORTI
 - DaVinciTools/IGeomDispCalCulator.h
   src/GeomDispCalculator.{h,cpp}
   . propagate change from DaVinci v8r3 that was built on a branch  
   
!========================== DaVinciTools v8r3 2003-12-12 ==================
! 2003-12-12 - Gloria CORTI for Miriam GANDELMAN
 Built on a branch v8r2b
 - DaVinciTools/IGeomDispCalCulator.h
   src/GeomDispCalculator.{h,cpp}
   . new interface method introduced to provide the error for each of
     the component of the IP vector. The method requires a Particle and
     a Vertex as input and returns 4 variables in the following order:
     the IP, the IP error, the full IP vector and the error on the IP
     vector.

!========================== DaVinciTools v8r1p2 2003-06-26 ==================

   not correctly progagated.

!=========================== DaVinciTools v6r0 2002-10-30 ===================
! 2002-10-29 - Gloria Corti
 - Comment temporarly the use of setIsResonance(true) in ParticleStuffer
   and LagrangeMassVertexFitter because of consequent missing step of
   intermediate particle when creating a new vertex in vertex fitters when
   daughters of resonaces are used.

! 2002-10-22 - Gloria Corti
 - Modified UnconstVertexFitter, LagrangeMassVertexFitter and
   GeomDispCalculator to be able to set which Transporter to use
   (CombinedTransporter beeing the default (as in v5r0)). An example of
   how to do it can be found in the DaVinciTest package.
 - Introduce new method in IMassVertexFitter to give 4 particles as input
   (C.Nunes, S.Amato)
 - Modified LagrangeMassVertexFitter (C.Nunes, A.Amato)
    + handle fits up to 4 particles,
    + set the flag isResonance() to new particles if lifetime < exp-15sec
    + check if a particle is a resonace in which case uses the daughters
      to perform the fit when widht < 10 MeV
    + fix error reported by B.Viaud to use transported values of slopes
      and momentum and not only positions
 - Modified UnconstVertexFitter (S.Amato) 
    + check if a particle is a resonace in which case uses the daughters
      to perform the fit
