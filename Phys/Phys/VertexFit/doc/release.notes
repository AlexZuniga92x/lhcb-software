! 2004-12-14 - P. Koppenburg for Luis Fernandez
  - src/UnconstVertexFitter.*
    . Add the possibility to treat photons correctly
    . Make it a GaudiTool
    -> yet to be tested
  
!========================== VertexFit v1r2 2004-12-01 ===================
! 2004-11-25 - Yuehong Xie
  - Modified KFFitTool.cpp/.h to make it work with Ks

! 2004-11-04 - Yuehong Xie
 - New tool KFFitTool.cpp/.h basically does
  . recomputation of track covariance matrix to fix a bug in Particle class
  . vertex fitting with Kalman Filter method
  . mass constraint of narrow width resonant particles 
  . adding photon or photon pair to a vertex and giving correct covariance matrix 
  . At the moment Kshort is not reprocessed. 
 - LagrangeDirectionFitter.cpp/.h
  . Add new method fitWithDirection which returns the modified primary vertex
  . Now Direction fitter and LifetimeFitter give very similar result
 - LifetimeFitter.cpp
  . Always check if matrix inversion is successful or not


!========================== VertexFit v1r1 2004-09-16 ===================
! 2004-08-25 - P. Koppenburg
 - cmt/requirements
   . Do not export header files

!========================== VertexFit v1r0 2004-08-24 ===================
! 2004-08-24 - P. Koppenburg
 - Made a mistake while importing DaVinciFilter, overwriting VertexFit. 
   Had to remove all filters from VertexFit.

! 2004-08-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - New package VertexFit extracted from DaVinciTools,
   containing all vertex fitters and assocaited tools.

! 2004-08-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - Split DaVinciTools package into 
   . Phys/DaVinciKernel : DVAlgorithm, PhysDesktop and all Interfaces
   . Phys/ParticleMaker : All particle makers and the ParticleStuffer
   . Phys/DaVinciFilter : All Filter
   . Phys/VertexFit : All vertex fitters and the GeomDispCalculator.cpp
   . Phys/DaVinciTransporter : All transporters
   . Phys/DaVinciTools : Basically all high-level tools that are none
        of the abvove, f.i. DecayFinder, PreDV, CheckOverlap...    
   This split became necessary since DaVinciTools was become a huge monster
   containing unrelated stuff (what do the TrackTypeFilterCriterion and the 
   CombinedParticleMaker have in common?). Also DaVinciTools was evolving
   with all versions of DaVinci. In the short term, I hope that most 
   developments will affect DaVinciFilter, while the other packages will
   be rather stable except for bug fixes.
   
!========================== DaVinciTools v10r3 2004-08-23 ===================
! 2004-08-23 - Florence RANJARD
 - replace GaudiTools/ with GaudiAlg

!========================== DaVinciTools v10r0 2004-07-22 ===================
! 2004-07-20 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.cpp
    . Bug affecting only Windows
      -> put definitions
         Particle* part3 = pList[2];
         Particle* part4 = pList[3];
      in the sections where one knows that there are more than 2 particles.

  - src/LifetimeFitter.cpp
    . posMomCorr() was misused as the upper square in LifetimeFitter.cpp, 
      and this is fixed.
!========================= DaVinciTools v9r5 2004-06-04 ===================
! 2004-06-04 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/LagrangeGeomVertexFitter.cpp
    . String over two lines corrected for Windows
    
! 2004-05-11 - P. Koppenburg for Claudia Pereira Nunes
 - src/LagrangeGeomVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
 - DaVinciTools/IGeomVertexFitter.h
   . New constrained vertex fitting tool. This tool has two public methods. 
     One, called fitWithGeom, makes only a geometrical  constrained fit for 
     at most 4 tracks. It doesn't make any kind of invariant mass vertex fit, 
     like the LagrangeMassVertexFitter tool does, it just constrain the
     particles to come from the same point. The other method, called 
     fitWithGeomAndSubMass, makes a geometrical constrained fit and an 
     invariant mass constrained fit of any daughter which is a resonance 
     (with width < 10 MeV).  This method only works if there is a daughter 
     resonance and it works for at most 4 tracks also. 
 - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
   . Corrected an error on the way the geometrical constrained 
     equations were being obtained.

!========================== DaVinciTools v9r2 2004-03-31 ==================
! 2004-03-30 - P. Koppenburg for Miriam Gandelman
 - src/GeomDispCalculator.cpp
   . Bug fix
  
!========================== DaVinciTools v8r4 2004-01-29 ==================
! 2004-01-14 - Gloria CORTI
 - DaVinciTools/IGeomDispCalCulator.h
   src/GeomDispCalculator.{h,cpp}
   . propagate change from DaVinci v8r3 that was built on a branch  
   
!========================== DaVinciTools v8r3 2003-12-12 ==================
! 2003-12-12 - Gloria CORTI for Miriam GANDELMAN
 Built on a branch v8r2b
 - DaVinciTools/IGeomDispCalCulator.h
   src/GeomDispCalculator.{h,cpp}
   . new interface method introduced to provide the error for each of
     the component of the IP vector. The method requires a Particle and
     a Vertex as input and returns 4 variables in the following order:
     the IP, the IP error, the full IP vector and the error on the IP
     vector.

!========================== DaVinciTools v8r1p2 2003-06-26 ==================
! 2003-06-26 - Gloria CORTI
 - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.h & cpp
   . introduce method finalize where tools are released (valgrind 
     possible memory leak)
 - src/GeomDispCalculator.h & cpp
   . introduce method finalize where tools are released (valgrind
     possible memory leak )
   . introduce protection in method calcVertexDis() when dist = 0
     appearing wtih special configuration of Bd->D0 K* jobs (Miriam
     GANDELMAN)
!========================== DaVinciTools v8r1 2003-06-03 ====================
! 2003-05-05 - Gerhard Raven
 - DaVinciTools/ILifetimeFitter.h
 - src/LifetimeFitter.{cpp,h}
   . add code to compute, given a particle and its production vertex,
     the corresponding particle lifetime

! 2002-11-11 - Gloria Corti
 - Fix problem in tree propagation in UnconstVertexFitter when using 
   resonances and fix bug reported by Gerhard Raven of hessian/2 (Sandra Amato)
 - Introduce property with cut value on width of mother particle in order to
   use products or not to make vertex in LagrangeMassVertexFitter (S.Amato)
   leave uncommented the setIsResonance. When using this tool the tree is still
   not correctly progagated.

!=========================== DaVinciTools v6r0 2002-10-30 ===================
! 2002-10-29 - Gloria Corti
 - Comment temporarly the use of setIsResonance(true) in ParticleStuffer
   and LagrangeMassVertexFitter because of consequent missing step of
   intermediate particle when creating a new vertex in vertex fitters when
   daughters of resonaces are used.

! 2002-10-22 - Gloria Corti
 - Modified UnconstVertexFitter, LagrangeMassVertexFitter and
   GeomDispCalculator to be able to set which Transporter to use
   (CombinedTransporter beeing the default (as in v5r0)). An example of
   how to do it can be found in the DaVinciTest package.
 - Introduce new method in IMassVertexFitter to give 4 particles as input
   (C.Nunes, S.Amato)
 - Modified LagrangeMassVertexFitter (C.Nunes, A.Amato)
    + handle fits up to 4 particles,
    + set the flag isResonance() to new particles if lifetime < exp-15sec
    + check if a particle is a resonace in which case uses the daughters
      to perform the fit when widht < 10 MeV
    + fix error reported by B.Viaud to use transported values of slopes
      and momentum and not only positions
 - Modified UnconstVertexFitter (S.Amato) 
    + check if a particle is a resonace in which case uses the daughters
      to perform the fit
    + fix error reported by B.Viaud to use transported values of slopes
      and momentum and not only positions

! 2002-09-11 - Gloria Corti
 - New tool NeutralParticleMaker from Frederic Machefert
 - Modification in GeomDispCalculator and ParticleStuffer to take into
   account different dimension in error correlation matrix in Particle
 - Changes in PhysDesktop to fix bug noted by Sandra of copying initial
   particle when daughters of a new particle.
 - Use PhysEvent v7r0 and increase version number

!=========================== DaVinciTools v5r0 2002-07-29 ===================

 - Add error calculation in DCA for parallel particles in 
   GeomDispCalculator ( M.Gandelman )
