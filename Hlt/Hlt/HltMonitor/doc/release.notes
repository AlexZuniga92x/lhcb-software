 - Initial import of package
 - The package contains code which allows the running of some monitoring tasks
   on the raw data where the input files are split over a number of processes
   while the main process collects data and fills histograms.
 - Currently three monitoring "algorithms" are available:
   - Vertex, creates histograms of filtered and unfiltered PV3D vertices
   - Rate, creates rate plots for all Hlt lines and routing bits
   - Mass, creates plots for the number of candidates and their mass for a
     selected number of Hlt lines
 - The monitor.py scripts is the main program; use its --help option for more
   information.
 - The monitoring currently only works in the online environment.
