! Package     : Hlt/Hlt1Lines
! Responsible : Gerhard Raven
! Purpose     : Definition and Configuration of Hlt1Lines
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2011-01-19 - Johannes Albrecht
 - move velo GEC to 10k as we use always SPD < 900

!========================== Hlt1Lines v6r1   2011-01-18 ===================
! 2011-01-10 - Johannes Albrecht
 - move to loose GEC in 1Track
 - resurrect micro bias Velo

!========================== Hlt1Lines v6r0   2010-12-08 ===================
! 2010-11-22 - Vanya Belyaev

 - Hlt1Lines/Hl1Units.py
    remove the obsolete symbols.. 

! 2010-11-19 - Roel Aaij
 - Hlt1Lines/Hl1Units.py
   - remove unused upgrade and match configuration symbols
 - Hlt1Lines/Hlt1GECs.py
   - Add a line to the preambulo to enable usage in new event model

! 2010-11-16 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Hlt1Lines/Hl1Units.py
    remove the obsolete symbols.. 

! 2010-10-18 - Vladimir Gligorov
 - add Hlt1NoPVPassThroughDecision to Hlt1MuonLines: a passthrough for L0
   muon lowMult events into Hlt2  

! 2010-10-12 Gerhard Raven
 - fix GEC configuration: the code assumed a private tool, when it actually
   is a public one...

! 2010-10-09 Gerhard Raven
 - scale the empty-empty beamgas contribution

! 2010-10-08 Gerhard Raven
 - replace IP in 1Track by |IP|

!========================== Hlt1Lines v5r2   2010-09-29 ===================
! 2010-09-29 Gerhard Raven
 - canonicalize L0TCK so that both '0x002a' and '0x002A' are properly treated...

! 2010-09-29 Plamen Hopchev
 - Several Changes to Hlt1BeamGasLines in regards to the creation of Hlt2BeamGasLines: 
   -- The BeamGasCrossing and ForcedRZ lines now run only on events with BXType = 3 (before
      there was no BXType requirement)  
   -- put FractionOfUnusedClusterCut in __slots__ and decreased its value from 0.27 to 0.23
   -- loosened a bit the cuts on the pseudo-vertex
   -- increased the output rate limits		

!========================== Hlt1Lines v5r1   2010-09-16 ===================
! 2010-09-16 Gerhard Raven
 - allow to give seperate Et cut for SingleElectronNoIP
 - run some muon lines on a new HighPt L0 muon channel

!========================== Hlt1Lines v5r0p1  2010-09-16 ===================
! 2010-09-16 Gerhard Raven
 - update the assumed L0-Odin mask: add empty to beam1, and beam2
   In practice, this will make the beam1 and beam2 beamgas lines also
   run on empty crossing (once they get accepted by Odin!)

!========================== Hlt1Lines v5r0   2010-09-08 ===================
! 2010-09-08 Gerhard Raven
 - make changes below compatible with TrackUpgrade changes
! 2010-09-08 Johannes Albrecht
 - add two muon lines with Velo GEC at 4000 for B2mm 

! 2010-09-08 - Gerhard Raven
 - follow changes to TrackUpgrade code in HltTracking v7r0: 
    common upgrades share now a common tool, centralizing the configuration
    in HltTracking instead of distributing amongst the lines (and then pray
    things are consistent!)
 - follow changes to TrackMatch code in HltTracking v7r0
    instead of MatchName which switches a bunch of settings in C++, this is
    now done explicitly in python

!========================== Hlt1Lines v4r3   2010-09-07 ===================

! 2010-09-07 - Gerhard Raven
 - ratelimit beamgas (almost) everywhere

! 2010-09-06 - Gerhard Raven

   do 'cvs update -j 1.5 -j 1.6 python/Hlt1Lines/Hlt1TrackLines.py' to get them back

! 2010-09-06 - Gerhard Raven
 - more automated daisy-chaining in Hlt1TrackLines.py

! 2010-08-02 - V. Gligorov
 - Hlt1GECs : a module which will contain the definitions of the GEC
              filters for Hlt1. Defines a filter on the number of IT

 - Hlt1CommissioningLines : add Velo/IT commissioning lines using the
                            above filters; rate limit to 5 Hz.

   two body hadronic signals only for now.
 - Update Hlt1Hadron lines with lines which do the 3D Velo reconstruction upfront.

!========================== Hlt1Lines v3r2 2010-04-21 ===================
! 2010-04-19 - V. Gligorov
 - DiHadron line now kills clones not by filtering the companion and
   confirmed tracks (which does not work if there is more than one
   confirmed track in the event) but by filtering the tracks making up
   the dihadron vertex using a new filter in HltCommon.

   electron alley bug fix

!========================== Hlt1Lines v3r0 2010-03-29 ===================

   write a warning, then assume an empty list of L0 channels

! 2010-02-24 - V. Gligorov
 - Follow progress of Savannah tasks 13784 and 12691 by updating Hlt1 lines
   to get their primary vertices from HltPVs.py and not HltReco.py 

! 2010-03-22 - Gerhard Raven
 - max rate limits in Hlt1MBNoBiasLine and Hlt1LumiLine prime numbers
   to avoid getting them in sync. With limits of 997 Hz and 97 Hz 
   respectively, this should become a 1% effect instead of a 100% one...

     Activate (uncomment) the configuration of the BeamGas Alley 
     Change the ODIN BXType to Beam1(2) instead of SingleBeamLeft(Right)      
     Put priority = 200 for both the beam-empty and the beam-beam Lines

!  2009-08-24 - Gerhard Raven
 - move import statements from global scope into local scope
   to avoid 'early import'

! 2009-08-21 - Gerhard Raven
 - improve daisy-chaining of logic & input/output in velo lines

! 2009-08-18 - Mariusz Witek
 - Modifications of electron and photon lines for ECAL partial decoding and faster electron radiation correction

! 2009-08-14 - Gerhard Raven
 - update names of 'decision' algorithms for Tell1Error, Incident and AlignVelo lines

!========================== Hlt1Lines v1r4 2009-08-10 ===================
! 2009-08-10 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Move Muon lines names to HltConf

! 2009-08-10 - Gerhard Raven
 - use callback mechanism in member to 'localize' the setup of fast 
   track fit
 - make HltFastTrackFit.py play nice with callback use
 - minor format changes to muon lines

! 2009-08-10 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Remove confusing and commented out ``DC06'' block from muon lines

! 2009-08-06 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove redundant DecodeVelo in muon lines

! 2009-08-06 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Better name of lines, and default prescales

! 2009-08-05 - Gerhard Raven
 - minor changes to the traversing track trigger for Velo closing
 - disable use of traversing track trigger, as it leaks memory

! 2009-08-05 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Moved HltDecodeRaw and HltReco to HltLine

! 2009-07-30 - David Hutchcroft
 - Updated HltVeloLine.py to match new PatVeloRTracking hit manager

!========================== Hlt1Lines v1r3 2009-08-04 ===================

! 2009-08-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove MuonNoGlob from HltL0Lines, move Hlt1IncidentLine down

!========================== Hlt1Lines v1r2 2009-07-28 ===================
! 2009-07-28 - Mariusz Witek
- removal of useless ElectronFromPi0 lines from HltElectronLines.py

! 2009-07-18 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove the VeloClosing line (defined as the OR of the A- and C-side
   VeloClosing lines) as with the regex functionality of HLT_PASS_RE this
   is no longer needed as an explicit line..
 - rename the VeloAlign line into AlignVelo such that Hlt1Velo.* does
   _not_ match it...

! 2009-07-17 - Gerhard Raven
 - add explicit velo decoding in front of VeloAlignFilter

! 2009-07-15 - Vanya BELYAEV

 - add Hlt1Units 


! 2009-07-14 - Plamen Hopchev
 - HltBeamGasLines.py: keep the lines as they are, but
   comment out the actual conf and addition to the Line 
   of the trig algos, as they are not yet in the release

! 2009-07-14 - Plamen Hopchev
 - HltBeamGasLines.py: bring it closer to what it is supposed to do - configure the 
   algorithms in the HltBeamGasAlley

! 2009-07-10 - Jaap Panman
 - HltBeamGasLines.py: adapt to changed BXType names in ODIN
 - HltLumiLines.py: adapt to changed BXType names in ODIN


!========================== Hlt1Lines v1r1 2009-07-03 ===================
! 2009-07-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - put in explicit rawbank decoding to avoid data-on-demand svc
 (needs corresponding version of HltConf)

! 2009-06-30 - Antonio Perez-Calero
 - minor fix for electron lines in TEleConf.

! 2009-06-25 - Antonio Perez-Calero
 - Substitute 'TConf' reco for 'TMuonConf' in muon lines and 'TEleConf' in electron 
   lines. Use specific tool instead of generic, due to changes in HltTrackUpgradeTool.
 - Implemented Alternative algorithm order in muon+track for improved timing. Both 
   active while testing. muon+track for jpsi will follow.

!========================== Hlt1Lines v1r0 2009-06-03 ===================
! 2009-05-28 - Gerhard Raven
 - initial import of bits from HltConf
