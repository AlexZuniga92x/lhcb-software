! Package     : Hlt/HltConf
! Responsible : Gerhard Raven
! Purpose     : HLT Configuration 
! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2009-02-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - add support for (nested) tool calls in Hlt1Lines, eg. the following:
               Hlt1Member ('TF', 'AntiEle' , FilterDescriptor = ['AntiEleConf,>,0.5'] 
                          , tools = [ Hlt1Tool( L0ConfirmWithT, tools = [ Hlt1Tool(PatConfirmTool, nSigmaX = 9 ) ], particleType = 2 )]
                          )
   will add a (private)( L0ConfigWithT tool, which the property
   particleType set to 2, and it will use a tool of type PatConfirmTool
   with nSigmaX set to 9.
   One caveat: a public tool configurable instance with 'dummy' in the name 
   is created in addition. This is due to a limitation of 'addTool'....

   add new keyword HLT into the line constructors.
   new keyword is a an argument for HltSelectionFilter algorithm, 
   to be used instead of L0-filter.

   also add few public functions:
    
     - hlt1InputSelections 
          get tuple with all known input selections
