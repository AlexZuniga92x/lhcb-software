 - included Cosmics in Hlt1.py again and update updated HltInit  
!========================== HltConf v5r0p1 2009-10-21 ===================

! 2009-10-21 - Gerhard Raven
 - if no Hlt2 activeLines in settings, do NOT run Hlt2 config...

!========================== HltConf v5r0 2009-10-17 =====================

 - remove HltRecoSequence from Hlt2 sequence. This sequence is now included

 - ALWAYS run the Hlt2 configuration, even if 'empty' Hlt2 (this possible now
   the above change has been made)

! 2009-10-14 - Gerhard Raven
 - update the HltType and HltThresholdSettings setup:
   o HltType is no longer an independent setable item, it is automatically
     determined by selecting a HltThresholdSetting.
     This implies that active Hlt1 and Hlt2 lines are now specified by HltThresholdSetting,
     and all configurables are executed. Note that if a thresholdsetting specifies
     an empty list of activeHlt2Lines, the Hlt2 configuration is NOT executed.
   o the names of the the ThresholdSettings have been regularized, eg.
     Effective_Nominal has become Physics_10000Vis_1000L0_40Hlt1_EffectiveHlt2_Jul09
     Charm_320Vis_300L0_10Hlt1 has become Physics_320Vis_300L0_10Hlt1_Aug09
   o HltThresholdSetting also specifies the matching L0 configuration, and
     informs the Hlt of this configuration. (note: it is not (yet) verified
     that the configured (assumed) L0 configuration is (at runtime) consistent
     with the actual input data)

! 2009-08-12 - Gerhard Raven
 - make sure 'log' is known in ThresholdUtils

! 2009-08-11 - Patrick Spradlin
  - Removed the DX lines from the scenario settings.  The DX lines were not
    part of the July scenario optimization, so they should not be in the
    'official' products of that optimization.
      python/HltConf/Charming_Nominal.py
      python/HltConf/Hadronic_Nominal.py
      python/HltConf/Leptonic_Nominal.py

!========================== HltConf v4r2 2009-08-10 ===================
! 2009-08-10 - Patrick Spradlin
  - Updated the thresholds for the Hlt2 Topological lines for the Hadronic,
      Leptonic, and Charming scenarios.  Relative to the previous tuning, this
      tuning treats the 4-body channels differently and includes a throttle
      at 7kHz on the robust stage accept rate.
      In this most recent tuning, the topological trigger was optimized with
      the 4-body lines turned on fully or turned off fully.  In this tuning,
      by '4-body lines' i mean every line that relies on a 4-body
      reconstruction in either the robust or the post-track-fit stage.
      Subject to the conditions of the tuning,  configurations with the
      4-body lines turned off performed significantly better than those with
      the 4-body lines turned on, so the changes committed exclude all of the
      4-body lines from ActiveLines
      
! 2009-08-10 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Make sure L0DUFormRawAlg is run when running Hlt2 requiring L0 but
   not running Hlt1

! 2009-08-10 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Last word (?) on ZPositions. Mail by Wouter :
     The problem is that the standard 'ConfiguredFastFitter' removes the states 
     by doing    
        fitter.AddDefaultReferenceNodes = False     
     This used to be
        fitter.ZPositions = []
     So, to get the relevant states you shouldn't comment out the line, but 
     restore the default value
        fitter.AddDefaultReferenceNodes = True
   -> do this.

! 2009-08-10 - Patrick Koppenburg

 Warning : Use
   HltConf().ThresholdSettings = 'Effective_Nominal' or any other valid
 or
   DaVinci().HltThresholdSettings = 'Effective_Nominal' or any other valid 
 or you will get a warning and use the default cuts for all lines.

   action
 - streamline end sequence configuration
 - change HltType decoding such that it works in cases where something more explcit
   than 'Hlt1+Hlt2', 'Hlt1', 'Hlt2', 'NONE' is specified

! 2009-08-03 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Decode 'TOPO+EXCL+PHI+LEPT' such that only what's required is run
   (allows to switch off lines easily)

! 2009-07-24 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Nasty bug : Instanciate configurables in HltThresHoldsSettings even
   if thresholds are not set. Else it's ignored. v4r0 tag moved.

! 2009-07-23 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Repeat the "21/7 version didn't work" bug fix for Hlt1. BANG HEAD!
   . Move threshold setting functionality to HltThresholdSettings
     to make sure that the same bug does not need to be fixed twice

! 2009-07-22 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Do not include Hlt2Lines.py from HltSelections anymore. This _kills_
   the following lines:

! 2009-07-20 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Added template Hlt2 configuration to HltThresholdSettings. 100% untested.
 - First set of changes to Configurations.py and Hlt1.py : Just a reshuffling 
   of Hl1t methods and slots (!) between Configuration.py and Hlt1.py.
   . Decoding of Hlt1 thresholds goes from Configuration to Hlt1
   . End sequence stuff goes from Hlt1 to Configuration
   . Completely backwards-compatible as far as I can tell.
 - tagged pkoppenb_20090720a (note the a)

  PatSeeding to Hlt/Track/Seeding, PatMatch to Hlt/Track/Match in HltReco.py
- added CreateFastTrackCollection to the HLT reco that copies longtracks found by

 - cleanup HltConf.HltReco a bit

! 2009-04-05 V. Gligorov
 - Make sure Hlt2TrackFitForTopo puts the tracks/particles in a location

   Configuration.py to adapt to new TCK DC09 (No GEC's)

! 2009-03-25 - Gerhard Raven
 - unify slots for prescale and postscale:
   every HltXXXLinesConf class now inherits from HltLinesConfigurableUser
   (which inherits from LHCbConfigurableUser) instead of from LHCbConfigurableUser
   directly.
   HltLinesConfigurableUser introduces 'Prescale' and 'Postscale' slots,
   which contain dictionaries of 'name' -> pre/postvalues. These get
   applied to each 'line' by adding 'prescale = self.prescale' and 
   'postscale = self.postscale' to the constructor calls of the line,
   which will trigger a callback with the name of the line which is
   'matched' with the 'name' in the dictionary (wildcards are allowed).
   Default is a pre(post)scale of 1, and the default can be overruled
   by adding an explicit 'Prescale' ('Postscale') in the __slots__ of the
   derived class.

! 2009-03-25 - Jose A. Hernando
 - HltHadronLines.py small bugs in the line corrected, single and dihadron lines starts from L0 candidates, soft dihadron line added by default, presecale set to 0, dihadron line starts from all L0 candidates. Some primitive structure of blocks in the alley implemented.

 - add RichRecSysConf back, AND add REC as a dependency of the HLT project,
   and add RichRecSys as a dependency in the requirements in order to allow
   Hlt2 to run -- this is at best a temporary hack until this gets sorted
   out correctly...
  
! 2009-03-20 - Marco Cattaneo

! 2009-02-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - add support for (nested) tool calls in Hlt1Lines, eg. the following:
               Hlt1Member ('TF', 'AntiEle' , FilterDescriptor = ['AntiEleConf,>,0.5'] 
                          , tools = [ Hlt1Tool( L0ConfirmWithT, tools = [ Hlt1Tool(PatConfirmTool, nSigmaX = 9 ) ], particleType = 2 )]
                          )
   will add a (private)( L0ConfigWithT tool, which the property
   particleType set to 2, and it will use a tool of type PatConfirmTool
   with nSigmaX set to 9.
   One caveat: a public tool configurable instance with 'dummy' in the name 
   is created in addition. This is due to a limitation of 'addTool'....
