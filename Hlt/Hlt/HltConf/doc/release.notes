! Package     : Hlt/HltConf
! Responsible : Gerhard Raven
! Purpose     : HLT Configuration 
! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


! 2009-07-29 - Geraldine Conti
- Added configuration lines for Hlt2Bs2JpsiPhiLines, Hlt2Bd2JpsiKstarLines and Hlt2Bu2JpsiKLines in Hlt2.py

! 2009-07-29 - Young Min Kim
 - Added configuration lines for Hlt2B2PhiXLines (just added in Hlt/Hlt2Lines) in Hlt2.py

!========================== HltConf v4r0 2009-07-23 ===================

! 2009-07-24 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Nasty bug : Instanciate configurables in HltThresHoldsSettings even
   if thresholds are not set. Else it's ignored. v4r0 tag moved.

! 2009-07-23 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Repeat the "21/7 version didn't work" bug fix for Hlt1. BANG HEAD!
   . Move threshold setting functionality to HltThresholdSettings
     to make sure that the same bug does not need to be fixed twice

! 2009-07-22 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Do not include Hlt2Lines.py from HltSelections anymore. This _kills_
   the following lines:
   . Hlt2LineB2TwoBody
   . Hlt2LineBs2PhiPhi
   . Hlt2LineHidValley
   . Hlt2LineZ02MuMu
   . Hlt2LineDrellYan
 - Bug fix : 21/7 version didn't work

! 2009-07-22 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Add Hlt2DisplVerticesLines (Neil Gauvin) to Hlt2

! 2009-07-21 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Add Inclusive Phi cuts (read from Vava/Kim/Magnus slides at Hlt2/Phy meeting)
 - Use Configurables in threshold settings, not 'PU', 'HA', ...
   . Adapt Hlt1 and Hlt2 accordingly
 - Add B2LLX Lines to exclusive 

! 2009-07-20 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - First working version of Hlt2 threshold settings. Presently only topo 
   implemented
   . HltThresholdSettings : Prescales need to be dictionaries
                            use Configurables names instead of shortcuts
   . Hlt2 : read and use HltThresholdSettings
 - tagged pkoppenb_20090720 (no a)

! 2009-07-20 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Added template Hlt2 configuration to HltThresholdSettings. 100% untested.
 - First set of changes to Configurations.py and Hlt1.py : Just a reshuffling 
   of Hl1t methods and slots (!) between Configuration.py and Hlt1.py.
   . Decoding of Hlt1 thresholds goes from Configuration to Hlt1
   . End sequence stuff goes from Hlt1 to Configuration
   . Completely backwards-compatible as far as I can tell.
 - tagged pkoppenb_20090720a (note the a)

! 2009-07-18 - Gerhard Raven
 - use regex where appropriate: no longer need eg. HltLumiDecision or 
    HltVeloClosingDecision or even Hlt1IgnoringLumi..

! 2009-07-16 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Update MuonID as suggested by Miriam

! 2009-07-14 - Plamen Hopchev

! 2009-07-12 - Patrick Spradlin
  - python/HltConf/Hlt2.py
    Fixed a bug in Hlt2Conf that was preventing it from correctly recognizing
    Hlt2Requires = "NONE".

  sequence via a switch in the beginning of HltReco.py
- implemented the possibility to use the fast kalman fit in the HLT2 reco sequence

- implemented the possibility to flag clones at the end of the HLT2 reco via a

- Added options to ChargedProtoPAlg in Hlt2TrackfitForTopo.py, Hlt2TrackFitForIncPhi.py
  so that tracks flagged as clones are not used to make charged particles.
- changed the output containers for the HLT reco: PatForward writes to Hlt/Track/Forward,
  PatSeeding to Hlt/Track/Seeding, PatMatch to Hlt/Track/Match in HltReco.py
- added CreateFastTrackCollection to the HLT reco that copies longtracks found by
  different Pat Algorithms and writes the to Hlt/Track/Long. Original tracks are kept

! 2009-05-05 - Antonio Perez-Calero

 - cleanup HltConf.HltReco a bit

! 2009-04-05 V. Gligorov
 - Make sure Hlt2TrackFitForTopo puts the tracks/particles in a location
   clearly labelled with 'ForTopo' to avoid conflicts with other fast fits

! 2009-03-25 - Antonio Perez-Calero
 - Replaced L0 channel "MuonNoGlob" for "Muon" in HltMuonLines.py, HltL0Candidates.py and
   Configuration.py to adapt to new TCK DC09 (No GEC's)

! 2009-03-25 - Gerhard Raven
 - unify slots for prescale and postscale:
   every HltXXXLinesConf class now inherits from HltLinesConfigurableUser
   (which inherits from LHCbConfigurableUser) instead of from LHCbConfigurableUser
   directly.
   HltLinesConfigurableUser introduces 'Prescale' and 'Postscale' slots,
   which contain dictionaries of 'name' -> pre/postvalues. These get
   applied to each 'line' by adding 'prescale = self.prescale' and 
   'postscale = self.postscale' to the constructor calls of the line,
   which will trigger a callback with the name of the line which is
   'matched' with the 'name' in the dictionary (wildcards are allowed).
   Default is a pre(post)scale of 1, and the default can be overruled
   by adding an explicit 'Prescale' ('Postscale') in the __slots__ of the
   derived class.

! 2009-03-25 - Jose A. Hernando
 - HltHadronLines.py small bugs in the line corrected, single and dihadron lines starts from L0 candidates, soft dihadron line added by default, presecale set to 0, dihadron line starts from all L0 candidates. Some primitive structure of blocks in the alley implemented.

!========================== HltConf v2r5 2009-03-23 ===================
! 2009-03-20 - Gerhard Raven
 - add RichRecSysConf back, AND add REC as a dependency of the HLT project,
   and add RichRecSys as a dependency in the requirements in order to allow
   Hlt2 to run -- this is at best a temporary hack until this gets sorted
   out correctly...
  
! 2009-03-20 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove RichRecSysConf from _used_configurables_ of Configuration.py, and add
   Configuration.py to ConfUserModules in requirements. Should fix problem of
   "HltConf not in database" affecting Moore and DaVinci in nightlies

 - Added fast-fit options used by topological in Hlt2TrackFitForTopo.py

                          , tools = [ Hlt1Tool( L0ConfirmWithT, tools = [ Hlt1Tool(PatConfirmTool, nSigmaX = 9 ) ], particleType = 2 )]
                          )
   will add a (private)( L0ConfigWithT tool, which the property
   particleType set to 2, and it will use a tool of type PatConfirmTool
   with nSigmaX set to 9.
   One caveat: a public tool configurable instance with 'dummy' in the name 
   is created in addition. This is due to a limitation of 'addTool'....

   add new keyword HLT into the line constructors.
   new keyword is a an argument for HltSelectionFilter algorithm,

     - hlt1InputSelections 
          get tuple with all known input selections

         'All'          : all input&output selections 
         'Input-Output' : all unmatched input selections 
         'Output-Input' : all unmatched output selections
