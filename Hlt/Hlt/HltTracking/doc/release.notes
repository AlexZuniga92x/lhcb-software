   . Add the ability to control the RICH radiators and particle
     hypotheses used in the reconstruction.
   . Add safety checks to make sure that tracking/pid configurations
     only get used for their intended purpose, e.g. that if someone
     configured an instance to make RICH-ID protons they cannot then
     use it to make pi0s.
   . Add genuine NoPIDs ProtoParticles, which are not overwritten with
     PID information by other tools.   
   . Remove the options UseRICH and UseCALO and replace them with methods
     to get RICH-IDd and CALO-IDd protoparticles.
   . Remove the option to both RICH and CALO ID charged hadrons. 
   . Fix assorted bugs.   

! 2010-03-23 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks #12691,13784.
   Split the neutral reconstruction into charged and neutral parts,
   so that lines which need electrons do not make photons, and that we
   don't ID electrons when making photons. Add a tracking configuration
   for making neutrals. 

! 2010-03-17 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks #12691,13784.

 (e.g. a muon) which may be forward and fitted, and velo tracks, and this vertex can
 be later upgraded forward and fitted. This now allows reco algos to change order for
 timing studies.

	- src/HltTrackSelector.h : updating the tool to select a track for DC06.
  - src/HltTracking.h : master algorithm to drive most of the reconstruction in the HLT code.
    It has different three configurations: for Velo,VeloTT,and Forward
    It has two modes: 
       1) Takes a Hlt::TrackContainer (a selection of tracks), it returns
the reconstructed tracks in an output Hlt::TrackContainer.
          For each track, it checks if was already reconstructed, and if so, it will the track not be reconstructed again.
      2) With no logical containers, assumes that the rest of the input tracks in the origial pat-container needs to be reconstructed. So, it finished the reconstruction. 
       i.e if it algorithms it is call with the configuration: Velo. It will loop in all the tracks in the Velo RZ track container, if the tracks has not been reconstructed a Velo Space yet, then it will be reconstructed. The final output will be in the pat-container, and copied, if needed into a logical Hlt::TrackContainer.
