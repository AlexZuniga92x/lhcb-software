! 2006-09-26 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Adapt to move of base classes to Hlt/HltBase

	- src/HltTrackSelector.h : updating the tool to select a track for DC06.
  - src/HltTracking.h : master algorithm to drive most of the reconstruction in the HLT code.
    It has different three configurations: for Velo,VeloTT,and Forward
    It has two modes: 
       1) Takes a Hlt::TrackContainer (a selection of tracks), it returns
the reconstructed tracks in an output Hlt::TrackContainer.
          For each track, it checks if was already reconstructed, and if so, it will the track not be reconstructed again.
      2) With no logical containers, assumes that the rest of the input tracks in the origial pat-container needs to be reconstructed. So, it finished the reconstruction. 
       i.e if it algorithms it is call with the configuration: Velo. It will loop in all the tracks in the Velo RZ track container, if the tracks has not been reconstructed a Velo Space yet, then it will be reconstructed. The final output will be in the pat-container, and copied, if needed into a logical Hlt::TrackContainer.

  - src/ removing HltForward and HltVeloTT algorithms: using HltTrackSelector tool instead
    src/HltTrackSelector.h .cpp tool to decide when to accpet a track to track
        use an options with mode: selected, rest, all

! 2006-01-19 Jose A. Hernando
	- cmt/requirements
	  depends on Pat-packages, and Hlt and Track Event Model
  - src/HltForward
    algorithm to steer the Forward reconstruction
    modes of operation (via option) = "selected","rest","all"
    track the seed Tracks that has been "selected", the one not-selected, or all
  - src/HltVeloTT	
    algorithm to steer the VeloTT reconstruction
    modes of operation (via option) = "selected","rest","all"
    track the seed Tracks that has been "selected", the one not-selected, or all
