   change BPVDIRA_MIN cut in D2HHHKsLines.py and the the Q_M_MIN/MAX
   and Q_AM_MIN/MAXa thresholds in CharmSpectroscopy.py

! 2016-01-27 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Changed the mass cut variable for combiners TagDecay and TagDecayWithNeutral,
   simple two-body combiners used in D* and Sigma_c reconstruction.  These
   combiners formerly cut on Delta m, the difference between the parent mass
   and the mass of its first decay product.  Use of this variable requires
   that the decay descriptors must be written with the decay products in a
   particular order, which is fragile and prone to errors.  The combiners were
   changed to cut on the energy release, Q, instead of Delta m.  Since the
   masses of all of the decay products are treated symmetrically in the
   calculation of Q, the decay descriptors no longer need a specific ordering
   of the decay produts.  Since these combiners are widely used in CharmHad
   and PID, many lines are affected by this change:

 - Fix bug from yesterday's commit

! 2016-01-26 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Removed some unused class definitions from CharmHad/Stages.py.
   The following combiner class definitions were removed:
     D2HHHHCombiner

! 2016-01-25 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Modifications to RareCharm/Stages.py.  Removed explicit unit conversions
   in cut strings of D2xxCombiner class.  Since the settings dictionaries
   also have unit conversions for these quantities, the conversions were
   happening twice.  Since the units involved, MeV and mm, are set to have
   the value 1.0, this double conversion should have had no functional effect.

! 2015-06-22 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Merged in changes from branch spradlin_20150615.
   For detailed descriptions of the changes, please see the doc/release.notes
   of the spradlin_20150615 branch.  Briefly:
   . Several bug fixes
   . Much rearrangement of code.
   . Major campaign to bring line names for the exclusive lines into a common
     convention.  The convention that i applied follows:
    Descriptive and unambiguous:  for each Hlt2 line in CharmHad that
      reconstructs an exclusive final state, the line name must fully and
      unambiguously describe the _physics_ decay mode.  Since the
      reconstructed decay mode sometimes differs from the physics mode for
      technical reasons, the line should describe the intended physics rather
      than the technical implementation.  If there are more than one line for
      a physics mode, additional description strings for the line should be
      appended to the name after an underscore, e.g., _LTUNB and _XSec.
    Sub-decays:  reconstructed subdecays must be full described.  Underscores
      will be used to separate subdecays from the top level decay and from
      each other.
    Particle ordering:  order the names of decay products by decreasing
      mass from left to right.  For particles with the same mass, e.g.
      conjugates, put the negatively charged one first.  The same ordering
      should be applied to subdecays when there are multiple subdecays at the
      same level:  list the heaviest subdecay first.
    'To' or '2':  i prefer 'To' to represent the decay operator in a decay
      formula, but either is acceptable as long as it does not introduce
      ambiguity.
    Charge conjugate decays:  the name should describe just one of the
      conjugate decays; 'DpToKS0Pip', not 'DpmToKS0Pipm'.  If a line does
      not select both conjugate decays of a final state that is not
      self-conjugate, the name must contain an additional description to this
      affect.
    Electric charge:  when the electric charge is part of the usual symbol for
      a particle, include it in the name, 'p' for positively charged, 'm' for
      negatively charged, '0' for neutral:  'Km', 'Kp', 'KS0', but 'Eta'.
      An exception is the proton, which should be 'Pp' or 'Pm' despite the
      usual symbols for proton and antiproton having no electrical charge.
    Camel case:  capitalize the first letter of each particle name.
    KS0 abbreviation:  when the reconstructed decay uses only 'long-long' or
      only 'down-down' KS0, this should be noted in the name.  The
      abbreviations KS0LL and KS0DD can be used in these cases as a combined
      subdecay and additional description.
    Pi0 abbreviation:  when the reconstructed decay uses only 'merged' or
      'resolved' calorimeter Pi0, this should be noted in the name.  The
      abbreviations Pi0M and Pi0R can be used in these cases as a combined
      subdecay and additional description.
    Eta abbreviations:  for calorimeter etas, use the same convention as for
      Pi0:  EtaR and EtaM can be used as combined subdecay and additional
      description to indicate respectively resolved or merged
      eta -> gamma gamma.  Use 'Etap' for eta^{prime}.  This does clash with
      the charge convention, but it should not cause ambiguity.
    Joint mass windows:  Often mass windows are specified wide enough to
      cover multiple particles exclusively reconstructed to the same final
      state.  This is common for D+ and D_s+ decays.  When this is the case,
      all of the intended particles should be listed before the 'To' or '2' in
      order of increasing mass, e.g., DpDspTo....
    Common particle names to be used:  Pim, Pip, Pi0, Km, Kp, KS0, Eta, Phi.
      Pp = proton, Lam = Lambda.  G = photon.  D0, Dp, Dsp.  Dstp = D^{*+},
      Dst0 = D^{*0}, Dsstp = D_s^{*+}.  Lcp = Lambda_c^+, Sc0 = Sigma_c^0, Scp,
      Scpp = Sigma_c^{++}.  Xic0, Xicp, Omc0 = Omega_c^0.

  . CharmHad:  Split the LcpToKmPpPip line into two lines:  one with a Lambda_c+
    mass window and one with a Xi_c+ mass window.  As a side effect, the
    mass windows of LcpToKmPpKp, LcpToPimPpPip, and LcpToPimPpKp are reduced
    to the Lambda_c+ mass window.

! 2015-04-16 - Michael Alexander
  - CharmHad/Hc2HHHHLines.py & CharmHad/Stages.py :
    - Changed the inputs of the detached Xic0->pKKpi line to the same as those
      for the LTUNB line in the same mode for the tight PID cuts. IP chi2 cuts
      are now performed only in the daughter cuts of the combiner. This brings
      the timing down to more manageable levels (particularly sharing inputs

			KsFilterForHHKs with instances
			  SharedKsLL
			  SharedKsDD
                        These have decay time cuts (really only relevant for KsLL) and VZ
                         cuts. They may be useful as inputs for additional lines

! 2015-03-24 - Olli Lupton
 - First commit for PID calibration lines:
  . Detached J/psi -> mumu and B+ -> (J/psi -> mumu)K+
  . Same with J/psi -> ee
  . Same with electrons from L0 candidates only
  . Detached phi -> mumu and Ds+ -> (phi -> mumu)pi+
  . KS0 long-long
  . Lambda0 long-long: filtered from common particles, highP, isMuon lines
  . downstream-downstream KS0 and Lambda0 lines turned off by default
 - These all run but cuts are not tuned (currently affected by bugs breaking
   L0 TISTOS and lack of muon ID for non-muon tracks).
 - These will mainly be cloned to the Turbo stream but this is not done yet.

 - Add 3-body XSection lines to CharmHad
 - Following discussions at the charm meeting and looking into the stripping lines,
   tighten the shared particle PID cuts in CharmHad a bit (still looser than current stripping cuts!)
   to reduce combinatorics timing. We may want to tighten these further still, but let's discuss as we go along.
 - Tighten shared particle IPCHI2 cuts to at least > 4 everywhere in CharmHad
   (except for lifetime unbiased of course) again to help reduce combinatorics timing
 - Rename the D02HHCombiner in Stages.py to be the DetachedD02HH..., in line with naming convention,
   propagate this through and add a different D02HHCombiner for the eventual lifetime unbiased lines.
 - Add the 2DD and LLDD D->KS0KS0 lines
 - Add a D->3h line for KPi calibration for Mika
 - Introduce ALL, >= 1, >= 2 layered PT cuts for the D->3H lines in line with the layered IPCHI2 cuts
   and set to the minimal values used in the 2015 draft XSec stripping lines throughout
 - Tighten non-XSec D->HHH/Lc->HHH lines to come closer to what is done in the stripping, modulo differences in logic.

   sequence regardless of the properties.  The presence of the filter in
   the line sequences is no longer conditional on the property ComRobUseGEC.
   Setting ComRobUseGEC to False will configure the filter as pass-all rather
   than omitting it.

 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py
   Reorganized the sequencing to remove the logical OR dependence on input
   kaons and pions.  This was achieved by making the 2-body reconstruction
   depend only on kaons rather than on the OR of kaons and pions.
   Dependence on pions enters at the 3-body reconstruction, and there it is
   introduced as an element in an ordinary sequencer.  Explicit dependence
   on PV3D has also been introduced prior to IP cuts on the input particles.

 - Separation of charm lines and topological lines.
   . Hlt2TopologicalLines.py: removal of charm lines and all code used
     exclusively by the charm lines.
   + Hlt2CharmLines.py: New configurable for the charm lines.  Contains all of
     the code required to define the charm lines from the previous version of
     Hlt2TopologicalLines.py.
   . This separation preserves the structure of the charm and topological
     triggers unchanged.
   . I have taken this opportunity to remove the symbol `Topo' from the names
     of all of the components of the charm lines, so there is no longer any
     excuse to call the charm trigger the `charm topo' or the `topo for charm'.
   . The Hlt/HltSettings tag spradlin_2010Jan12 relies on this change.

 - Hlt2TopologicalLines : Several minor changes
    . Removed last references to the DX lines (mostly comments).
    . Removed the obsolete IncludedLines slot and its handling.  The intended
      purpose is better implemented at higher level by the ActiveHlt2Lines
      mechanism in the HltSettings.
    . Put wrapper sequences around GooPions and GoodKaons to prevent some
      problems introduced by including them in the same sequence
      (Hlt2SharedTopo2Body_PionsORKaons) with ShortCircuit = False.

    * Changed default behavior of the 'GEC' limit on the number of tracks in
      an event.  It is now ON by default.
    * Rearranged some cuts to reduce the number of 4-body combinations
      transferred to the TES.
    * Turned the 4-body topological and charm lines back ON by default.
      For the moment, the 4-body DX line remains OFF by default.
    * Changed the way cut strings are built to use python's sprintf-style
      line formatting rather than string concatenation.

! 2009-06-26 - V. Gligorov & P. Spradlin
  - Add GEC machinery for the Hlt2Topological lines. It is now possible to
    cut on the number of tracks in an event and reject events which have too many
    tracks. Off by default -- switch on by setting ComRobUseGEC to true. Set
    ComRobGEC to adjust the cut value (default 120 tracks).
  - Add cut on the charge of the final 2,3, and 4 body candidates of the charm lines.
    The 2,4 body are required to have charge zero, the 3 body charge +-1.
  - Other minor changes to improve code usability.
