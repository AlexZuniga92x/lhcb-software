   Removed a vestigial reference to `Topo' by changing the name of
   Hlt2TopoTFInFilter to Hlt2B2DXTFInFilter.

! 2010-04-02 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py
   Added 3 one stage lines to the topological trigger (Hlt2TopoOSTF.Body)
   and slots to configure them.  The lines use fitted tracks as input and can
   be be configured indepently of the main topological.

! 2010-04-02 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py and Hlt2CharmLines.py
   Prepended __ to names of all methods that do not need to be public (all of
   them).  Changed default values of slots for continuous values to floating 
   points (some of them were integer literals).  The values are unchanged.

! 2010-04-01 - Gerhard Raven
 - add some monitoring histograms to Hlt2ExpressLines

! 2010-03-31 - P. Spradlin
 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py, Hlt2CharmLines.py, and Hlt2B2DXLines.py
   Slightly modified the implementation of my previous change because i was
   a little unhappy with it.

! 2010-03-31 - Gerhard Raven
 - update Hlt2Transparent definition

! 2010-03-29 - P. Spradlin
 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py, Hlt2CharmLines.py, and Hlt2B2DXLines.py
   Modification to the filter on the number of tracks in an event (aliases GEC,
   KillTooManyIPFilter, etc.) so that the filter is always present in the
   sequence regardless of the properties.  The presence of the filter in 
   the line sequences is no longer conditional on the property ComRobUseGEC.
   Setting ComRobUseGEC to False will configure the filter as pass-all rather
   than omitting it.

   particular continuing with the removal of hardcoded track containers.

! 2010-02-24 - V. Gligorov
 - Contine the reorganization of Hlt tracking, see Savannah 13784, 12691
   for details. Minor changes to follow developments in HltLine and

! 2010-02-22 - V. Gligorov
 - Contine the reorganization of Hlt tracking, see Savannah 13784, 12691
   for details. Major changes in this round
   . All Hlt2Lines which specifically asked for primary vertices
     now pick them up from HltPVs, not HltReco.
   . Remove hardcoded track location in topological/charm/b2dx trigger
     line global event cuts. The correct container is now automatically picked
     up by asking the Hlt2 reconstruction for it.
   . Remove hardcoded location of hlt2 velo tracks in the displaced
     vertex lines, this is also now picked up by asking the Hlt2
     reconstruction for it.

!========================== Hlt2Lines v2r4 2010-02-17 ===================
! 2010-02-18 - V. Gligorov
 - Updates to inclusive triggers (Charm,Topo,Phi,B2DX) to follow changes
   in Hlt2PID. All now use the same fast-fit and instead of configuring
   their own fast-fit and PID simply pick up the correct particles
   from TFBasicParticles.
 - Fix minor bug in Hlt2diphotonDiMuonLines which was causing a large printout
   from one of the filters.

! 2010-02-16 - Jacopo Nardulli

 - Hlt2CharmLines.py
   Reorganized the sequencing to remove the logical OR dependence on input
   kaons and pions.
 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py
   Minor sequencing fix.

! 2010-01-13 - Patrick Spradlin
  https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?59641
 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py
   Reorganized the sequencing to remove the logical OR dependence on input
   kaons and pions.  This was achieved by making the 2-body reconstruction
   depend only on kaons rather than on the OR of kaons and pions.
   Dependence on pions enters at the 3-body reconstruction, and there it is
   introduced as an element in an ordinary sequencer.  Explicit dependence
   on PV3D has also been introduced prior to IP cuts on the input particles.

! 2010-01-12 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Separation of charm lines and topological lines.
   . Hlt2TopologicalLines.py: removal of charm lines and all code used
     exclusively by the charm lines.
   + Hlt2CharmLines.py: New configurable for the charm lines.  Contains all of
     the code required to define the charm lines from the previous version of
     Hlt2TopologicalLines.py.
   . This separation preserves the structure of the charm and topological
     triggers unchanged.
   . I have taken this opportunity to remove the symbol `Topo' from the names
     of all of the components of the charm lines, so there is no longer any
     excuse to call the charm trigger the `charm topo' or the `topo for charm'.
   . The Hlt/HltSettings tag spradlin_2010Jan12 relies on this change.

 - Hlt2TopologicalLines : Several minor changes
    . Removed last references to the DX lines (mostly comments).
    . Removed the obsolete IncludedLines slot and its handling.  The intended
      purpose is better implemented at higher level by the ActiveHlt2Lines
      mechanism in the HltSettings.
    . Put wrapper sequences around GooPions and GoodKaons to prevent some
      problems introduced by including them in the same sequence
      (Hlt2SharedTopo2Body_PionsORKaons) with ShortCircuit = False.

! 2009-06-29 - Patrick Spradlin
  - Several changes to python/Hlt2Lines/Hlt2TopologicalLines.py
    * Changed default behavior of the 'GEC' limit on the number of tracks in
      an event.  It is now ON by default.
    * Rearranged some cuts to reduce the number of 4-body combinations
      transferred to the TES.
    * Turned the 4-body topological and charm lines back ON by default.
      For the moment, the 4-body DX line remains OFF by default.
    * Changed the way cut strings are built to use python's sprintf-style
      line formatting rather than string concatenation.

  - move some import statements in Hlt2B2JpsiX to avoid 'premature' import

! 2009-06-26 - V. Gligorov & P. Spradlin
  - Add GEC machinery for the Hlt2Topological lines. It is now possible to
    cut on the number of tracks in an event and reject events which have too many
    tracks. Off by default -- switch on by setting ComRobUseGEC to true. Set
    ComRobGEC to adjust the cut value (default 120 tracks).
  - Add cut on the charge of the final 2,3, and 4 body candidates of the charm lines.
    The 2,4 body are required to have charge zero, the 3 body charge +-1. 
  - Other minor changes to improve code usability.

! 2009-06-26 - V. Gligorov
  - Fixed a number of silly bugs in XGamma lines.
