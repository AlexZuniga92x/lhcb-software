  - Initial version for testing.
  - The Hlt2DisplVertices algorithm essentially loops on all reconstructed vertices.
	The one with lowest z is not considered.
	Vertices with at least one backward track are not considered.
	2 kinds of cuts are applied to the set of displaced vertices :
	>1 prey passing thighter cuts  --> when hunting single long-lived particles
	>2 preys passing looser cuts  --> when looking for 2 particles, coming from a mother one.
	To allow for kinematical cuts, association is done between the Velo
	tracks participating to the vertex and the reconstructed Hlt2Pions.
	When no Hlt2Pions found, default pions with 0.4 GeV pt are created.
	Vertices that are found to be close to the detector material could be possibly eliminated.
