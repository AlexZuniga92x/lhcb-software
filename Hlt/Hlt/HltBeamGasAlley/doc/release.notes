	- remove 2 lines in BeamGasVertexCut in order to run with DaVinci v19r14
	- the first was m_outputSelection->clear(), before writing the output selection to TES
	- the second was print of the output selection name, which is private (now?) data member of HltAlgorithm

	- src/BeamGasTrigCheckL0AndTracks.h (.cpp) : decision algorithm which confirms the L0 decision
	                                             and check the RZ tracks container
	- src/BeamGasTrigClusterCut.h (.cpp)       : decision algorithm (inheriting GaudiAlg) which evaluates the 
						     fraction of unused clusters and lets through only the events 
						     with high fraction of unused clusters 
	- src/BeamGasTrigExtractClusters.h (.cpp)  : extracts the unused (lite) clusters to a new container
	- src/BeamGasTrigVertexCut.h (.cpp)        : decision algorithm which creates a "vertex" histogram and
						     triggers events with high value of the maximum bin 
	- src/BeamGasTrigBGOnlyL0.h (.cpp)         : decision algorithm which confirms the L0 decision and checks
						     the bunch-crossing type from ODIN
	
! More details:
	- The two beam-gas alleys are called BeamGasWithPPAlley and BeamGasOnlyAlley
	- Both of them use the PatVeloRTracking algorithm
