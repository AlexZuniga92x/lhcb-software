! 2014-01-23 - Gerhard Raven
 - run clang-format 

! 2014-01-22 - Gerhard Raven
 - replace BOOST_FOREACH with C++11 range-based for
 - replace explicit loops with STL algorithms + lambda

! 2014-01-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration.

!========================= HltBeamGasAlley v3r1p1 2013-04-09 =========================
! 2013-03-27 - Rob Lambert
 - Expect test failure


! 2013-03-25 - Rob Lambert

! 2013-03-25 - Rob Lambert
 - Fix test problems


! 2013-03-22 - Rob Lambert
 - Add a huge number of qmtests, dummy tests mostly checking instantiation

!========================= HltBeamGasAlley v3r1 2013-02-28 =========================
! 2013-02-27 - Rob Lambert
 - protect debug messages, task #40215

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v3r0   2012-03-29 =================
! 2011-03-27 Plamen Hopchev
 - simplification of the logic of the search. Now do just one extension in fwd
   or bkw direction
 - execute the reverse_iteration only if the fwd iteration was not successful
 - fill the output track selection only once (either in the fwd or reversed iteration) 
 - add more protections: stepSizes and max number of executions of the MainStep while-loop

! 2011-03-25 Gerhard Raven
 - fix duplicate entries during extension
 - avoid sorting twice

! 2011-03-24 Gerhard Raven
 - add a few const to make it easier to understand what is going on...
 - write findProtoVertex using iterators instead of indices

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r5   2012-03-02 =================
! 2011-03-02 Plamen Hopchev
 - remove all obsolate src files and leave only the new proto vertexing algo

! 2011-03-01 Plamen Hopchev
 - added new proto vertexing algorithm. The rest files in /src become obsolate 

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r4p1   2011-02-16 =================
! 2011-02-11 Gerhard Raven
 - add VeloDet to dependencies

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r4   2011-01-20 =================
! 2011-01-20 Gerhard Raven
 - migrate to use HltSelectionContainer

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r3p1 2010-03-28 =================

 - remove unneccessary code

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r3 2010-02-17 =================
! 2010-02-15 Gerhard Raven
 - fix compiler warning

! 2010-02-14 Plamen Hopchev
 - use variable bin-width in BeamGasTrigVtxCut

! 2010-02-13 Gerhard Raven
 - do not produce error() message that doesn't flag an error...

! 2010-02-12 Gerhard Raven
 - change float to double

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r2p3 2010-01-11 =================
! 2009-12-23 Gerhard Raven
 - move #include around to facilitate HltBase/stringKey -> GaudiKernel/StringKey migration 


!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r2p2 2009-12-09 =================
! 2009-12-09 Gerhard Raven
 - remove unneeded include "HltBase/stringKey.h"

!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r2p1 2009-10-17 =================
! 2009-10-17 Gerhard Raven
 - add cmt/.cvsignore
!========================== HltBeamGasAlley v2r2 2009-08-31 ===================
! 2009-08-31 Gerhard Raven
 - fix warnings in nightly build

! 2009-07-13 Plamen Hopchev
        - v2r1
        - only changes in BeamGasTrigVertexCut.cpp in order to use a vector holding the
          z_r0 of the RZ tracks instead of a histogram 

! 2008-11-28 Plamen Hopchev
	- v2r0
	- runs with DaVinci v20r3 (Hlt v4r3)
	- Option files: general reorganizing of the option files. 
	  Now there are just 2 option files: 
	  * DaVinci-BeamGas.py - Almost 1-to-1 copy of DaVinci.py with changes 
	    of the input files ( 2 private (Massi) signal and 1 background files are included )
	  * BeamGasAlleys.py   - Setting the Algorithms Sequences and configuration 
	    of the added algorithms
        - Algorithms:
	  * Now we have just 1 algorithm to check the L0Decision, The existance of 
	    RZTracks and Bunch-crossing type. I.e. BeamGasTrigCheckL0TracksBXType 
	    insted of BeamGasTrigCheckL0AndTracks and BeamGasTrigBGOnlyL0.	    
	    It is used by the 2 sub-alleys, BeamGasWithPP and BeamGasOnly, 
	    with different values for the job-options.
	  * Changes in the algorithm BeamGasTrigVertexCut in order to comply with 
	    changes in the HLT package.

	- v1r2
	- note on the previous version (v1r1): It doesn't compile/run under DaVinci v19r14 !!!
	  so the neccesary changes still to be done. This version will not work under v19r14 too.
	- the changes here are just renaming of some of the job-option names. They are
	  consistent with the names used in the Beam-Gas trigger note.


! 2008-07-15 Plamen Hopchev
	- v1r1
	- remove 2 lines in BeamGasVertexCut in order to run with DaVinci v19r14
	- the first was m_outputSelection->clear(), before writing the output selection to TES
	- the second was print of the output selection name, which is private (now?) data member of HltAlgorithm
	

! 2008-07-14 Plamen Hopchev
	- v1r0
	- src/BeamGasTrigCheckL0AndTracks.h (.cpp) : decision algorithm which confirms the L0 decision
	                                             and check the RZ tracks container
	- src/BeamGasTrigClusterCut.h (.cpp)       : decision algorithm (inheriting GaudiAlg) which evaluates the 
						     fraction of unused clusters and lets through only the events 
						     with high fraction of unused clusters 
	- src/BeamGasTrigExtractClusters.h (.cpp)  : extracts the unused (lite) clusters to a new container
	- src/BeamGasTrigVertexCut.h (.cpp)        : decision algorithm which creates a "vertex" histogram and
						     triggers events with high value of the maximum bin 
	- src/BeamGasTrigBGOnlyL0.h (.cpp)         : decision algorithm which confirms the L0 decision and checks
						     the bunch-crossing type from ODIN
	
! More details:
	- The two beam-gas alleys are called BeamGasWithPPAlley and BeamGasOnlyAlley
	- Both of them use the PatVeloRTracking algorithm
	- Job-option files: /afs/cern.ch/lhcb/group/vertex/vol6/phopchev/BeamGasForHlt/opts/
