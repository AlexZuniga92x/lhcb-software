! Package     : Hlt/HltLine
! Responsible : Gerhard Raven, Vanya Belyaev
! Purpose     : Infrastructure for HLT 'lines'
! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2010-08-18 - V.Gligorov
 - New Hlt1Member to allow filtering on Particles.
! 2010-08-18 - Gerhard Raven
 - handle None as a member (just skip it)
! 2010-08-13 - Gerhard Raven
 - more elegant python import
!========================== HltLine v4r4  2010-07-02 ===================
! 2010-07-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - create infrastructure for default VoidFilter cuts in each Hlt2 line

!========================== HltLine v4r3  2010-05-27 ===================
! 2010-05-19 - V. Gligorov
 - Let HltLine know about new filters to cut on impact parameter, vertex
   separation significances.

!========================== HltLine v4r2  2010-05-20 ===================
! 2010-05-19 - Johannes Albrecht
 - add file with HTL2 monitoring definitions

!========================== HltLine v4r1  2010-04-21 ===================
! 2010-04-16 - V. Gligorov
 - Let HltLine know about helper functions to be used in the lifetime unbiased
   hlt1 hadron lines, code written by U. Kerzel. 

!========================== HltLine v4r0  2010-03-28 ===================
! 2010-03-17 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks #12691,13784.
   Move reconstruciton code to HltTracking, including 
     HltPVs
     HltReco
     Hlt2Tracking
     Hlt2TrackingConfigurations
     HltTrackNames
     HltVertexNames
   Tell HltLine about the output location of the Match reconstruction.
 
! 2010-03-15 - V. Gligorov
 - Update HltLine to tell it about where the Match reconstruction puts its
   output tracks.

! 2010-03-11 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks 13784 and 12691. See Savannah pages
   for details.  

! 2010-03-07 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks 13784 and 12691. Clean up the tracking
   sequenes in Hlt2Tracking; each subsequence now returns a self-sufficient
   bindMembers instance. Move all creation of the sequences to the apply
   configuration method and fill list of used configurables in order to
   apply the configuration in the correct order.

! 2010-03-02 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks 13784 and 12691. Major changes
   in this round
   . Create Hlt2TrackingConfigurations which now holds all the 
     tracking configurations which are known to Hlt2
   . Modify Hlt2Tracking and HltTrackNames so that both creation
     and retrieval of track containers is done in the same way
     by passing the concrete instance of the tracking to the
     relevant function in HltTrackNames

! 2010-02-26 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks 13784 and 12691. Major changes 
   in this round
   . Create HltVertexNames to complement HltTrackNames
   . Add new symbols to HltTrackNames. Move the "rules" which define
     track and protoparticle containers from Hlt2Tracking to
     HltTrackNames
   . Make PV2D and PV3D functions to isolate one from the other

! 2010-02-24 - V. Gligorov
 - Contine the reorganization of Hlt tracking, see Savannah 13784, 12691
   for details. Major changes in this round
   . Move Hlt2PID here and rename it to Hlt2Tracking
   . Create new file HltTrackNames to hold shared container names
   . Remove almost everything from HltReco 
 
! 2010-02-22 - V. Gligorov
 - Contine the reorganization of Hlt tracking, see Savannah 13784, 12691
   for details. Major changes in this round
   . Export MinimalRZVelo from HltReco to allow Hlt2 reconstruction to be
     moved into Hlt2PID  
   . Create a new file HltPVs.py which defines the Hlt primary vertex 
     reconstruction. This correctly picks up the relevant pieces from
     HltReco and Hlt2PID and speels out the dependencies explicitly. 

!========================== HltLine v3r2  2010-03-04 ===================

   syntax.

!========================== HltLine v3r0 2010-02-01 ===================
! 2010-01-30 - Gerhard Raven
 - allow Hlt::TrackFilter and Hlt::TrackPipe as Hlt1Members
 - increase OutputLevel of DeterministicPrescaler to ERROR


! 2010-01-21 - Gerhard Raven
 - use DecodeL0DU consistently, do NOT instantiate a default L0DUFromRawAlg.

! 2010-01-19 - Gerhard Raven
 - move HLT agnostic part of HltLine in SelectionLine (which can be shared by
   the stripping), replace old HltLine by Hlt::Line which inherits from 
   ::Selection::Line
 - adapt python HltLine to HltLine -> Hlt::Line migration
 - change default Hlt2 HLT filter to just 'not exclusive lumi' (as Hlt1L0.* is 
   a tiny fraction of the Hlt1Global accepts)
 - remove obsolete and unused PV argument to Hlt2Line
 - update version in requirements to v3r0

!========================== HltLine v2r1 2010-01-11 ===================
! 2009-01-08 - V. Gligorov
 - python/HltLine.py : add MoveVerticesForSwimming and SelectTracksForSwimming
   to the list of allowed Hlt1Members

!========================== HltLine v2r0p1 2009-12-14 ===================
! 2009-12-14 - Gerhard Raven
 - fix Hlt2Line filter properly -- should have been HLT_PASS_RE('Hlt1(?!L0)(?!Lumi).*Decision')
   as an Hlt1ODIN line is used as passthrough in case Hlt2 requires only L0...
   (maybe we should use Hlt1L0Any instead???)

! 2009-12-13 - V. Gligorov
 -  python/HltLine/HltReco.py : revert change to velo reco. Note that using
    DecodeRawVeloBuffer() is broken with DC06 so any lines using this functionality
    must be prescaled to zero by default so as not to break the nightlies.

! 2009-12-13 - Gerhard Raven
 - update Hlt2Line hlt filter to HLT_PASS_RE('Hlt1(?!ODIN)(?!Lumi).*Decision')
   to avoid interference with Hlt2 requires L0... (pass-through Hlt1)

! 2009-12-13 - Patrick Koppenburg
 -  python/HltLine/HltReco.py : fix velo reco

! 2009-12-12 - V. Gligorov
 - python/HltLine/HltReco.py : fix Savannah bug #60543.

! 2009-12-10 - V. Gligorov
 - python/HltLine/HltReco.py : add objects for doing the full 3D Velo tracking and PV 
   reconstruction in the case of an open Velo.

 2009-12-04 - Gerhard Raven
  - update default Hlt2Line Hlt filter to HLT_PASS_RE('Hlt1(?!ODIN)(?!L0)(?!Lumi).*Decision')
    i.e. the same as 'bit 46'

!!========================== HltLine v2r0 2009-12-03 ===================
 2009-12-02 - Johannes Albrecht
  - HltReco.py: add dummy vertex position filters for monitoring of PV2D position

! 2009-11-27 - Patrick Koppenburg
   https://savannah.cern.ch/task/index.php?12690
 - Remove PV = True/False argument of HltLine. The PV should be loaded 
   explicitly when needed.

! 2009-11-26 - Antonio Perez-Calero
 - added histogram (profile) for the monitoring of number of candidates passing each 
   algorithm inside in a given line (implemented only for HltAlgorithms as used in Hlt1)

! 2009-11-25 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - The Hlt2 reconstruction is separated in blocks depending on what is actually
    needed. Allows to run making only muons and pions without 
    requiring the calo decoding, for instance.
    (https://savannah.cern.ch/task/?12690)
   . Remove Reco property of Hltline (backwards incompatible)
   . More to come
 - Requires tags pkoppenb_20091125 of HltConf, HltLine, Hlt2Lines, 
   HltSharedParticles
 - v2r0

! 2009-11-23 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Use PatPV2DFit3D in Hlt1 and PatPV3D in Hlt2. 
   . HltReco.py : Change algorithms to be used
   . HltLine.py : Depend on PV3D for Hlt2 lines requiring PV
   . Requires tags pkoppenb-20091123 of Hlt2SharedParticles and DaVinciTools.
 - v1r11

!========================== HltLine v1r10 2009-11-14 ===================
! 2009-11-14 - Gerhard Raven
 - keep track of _all_ output selections of an Hlt1 line

! 2009-11-05 - Gerhard Raven
 - no longer accept partial matches when setting pre- and postscales

!========================== HltLine v1r9 2009-11-05 ===================
! 2009-11-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - if an Hlt2 line does not require anything specific about Hlt1,
   add a filter to it which verifies that the event is not exclusive lumi,
   i.e. require HLT_PASS_RE('Hlt1(?!Lumi).*Decision')
 

!========================== HltLine v1r8 2009-10-28 ===================
! 2009-10-29 - Patrick Koppenburg

! 2009-10-17 - Gerhard Raven
 - create a branch compatible with old PatDownstream, i.e. REC_v7r6

! 2009-10-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - add a flag 'Reco' to Hlt2Lines constructor to flag if line wants
   reconstruction run or not. Default is True. Note: this is a temporary
   (quick) solution, would be better if reco is (automatically) pulled in 
   by the dependency resolution
 - in Hlt2Lines, 'usePV' now does PV2D instead of PV3D (as 2D is what 
   is used!)
 - streamline HltReco.py 

! 2009-10-13 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Adapt to new options of PatDownstream
 - v1r6p2

!========================== HltLine v1r6p1 2009-09-07 ===================

 - add callback support to member: allow to call a specified function after 
   the member has been used to create a configurable, with the instance as
   argument
