! Package     : OTCalibration
! Responsible : Wouter Hulsbergen
! Purpose     : Algorithm for OT rt and t0 calibration

! 2009-11-17 Alexandr Kozlinskiy
  - added new algorithm T0ModuleClbrAlg which will be used for timing
    calibration.

! 2009-10-09 Wouter Hulsbergen
  - adapted to changes in LHCb::Track

! 2009-09-06 Wouter Hulsbergen
  - cosmics analysis: Calo time is no longer stored in calo track segment, so
    I disabled using calo timing. This can be restored with a bit of work.
