 - release version v1r2 for Alignment v4r4


! 2009-11-17 Alexandr Kozlinskiy
  - added new algorithm T0ModuleClbrAlg which will be used for timing
    calibration.

! 2009-10-09 Wouter Hulsbergen
  - adapted to changes in LHCb::Track

! 2009-09-06 Wouter Hulsbergen
  - cosmics analysis: Calo time is no longer stored in calo track segment, so
    I disabled using calo timing. This can be restored with a bit of work.
 
! 2009-04-21 Johan Blouw
  - imported this package into alignment software project as 
    Calibration/OTCAlibration v1r0

! 2008-09-19
  - Added OTWriteConditions to xml. Dumps conditions in TES to xml.

! 2008-09-15
  - adapted to change in RtRelation

! 2007-09-10 Wouter Hulsbergen
  first import
