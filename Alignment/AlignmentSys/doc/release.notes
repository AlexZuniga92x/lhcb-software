Miscellaneous changes to keep up with the latest stack, the last stack which will be released on slc5 gcc46, underlying stack has changed significantly lot since the previous release, but not in a way which directly affects the alignment procedures themselves.

This is the first version to pick up Lbcom through the stack, rather than directly. 
This version also adds the functionality of the DecoderDB, see task #19106

New package:
 . MassMonitor, Package for making fits to 2D histograms (mass vs. VARIABLE)

Added temporarily:
 . Tr/TrackUtils v1r54, to fix alignment segfaults from upgrade detectors accidentally added into the sequence.

** There was a problem introduced by J. Blouw. I did not realize that
   in fact AlignSolvKernel was replaced with AligKernel. So, I had removed
   AlignSolvTools... which was wrong. I have put it back, and retagged the
   AlignmentSys package with the same tag.

- General comments/remarks
	. introduced configurables for the following packages
		- Escher
		- TAlignment
		- AlignTrTools
	. some of the already existing python scripts have been moved around a bit
	  (e.g. from TAlignment/python to TAlignment/python/TAlignment, or TAlignment/options)
	. in cae of TAlignment, the linker library has been removed
	. The escher configurable is more or less a cc of the Brunel one,
	  with adaptations, changes etc where deemed necessary.
	. Note: for this release, only the Kalman sequence & the Millepede sequence for OT layers
          has been configured & tested. Rest will follow soon...
 	. I noticed a small problem in the Millepede sequence, which will be resolved later as well.
	  - here, the piece of code which is used to convert the alignment constants determined by Millepede 
	    into constants in the LHCb coordinate system seems to have a bug... certain conditions are not found.
	. a new package has been introduced, called "MisAligner". It produces an executable which can be used to 
	  easily generate misaligned xml files (which then have to be manually uploaded into your favourite conditions
	  databasse.

- Packages added: AlignT2Velo
- Packages update: AlignmentInterfaces 	v2r2
 		   AlignmentTools      	v2r8
		   AlignTrTools		v3r2
		   SolvKernel		v1r1
		   AlignSolvTools	v2r1
		   TAlignment		v3r2
		   AlignT2Velo		v1r1
		   Escher		v2r2

- in AlignmentInterfaces  v2r2
	- added Centipede interface which inherits from Millepede,
          to accomodate different use of it by IT/OT from Velo.
        - added ITAConfig interface, which is used to configure the
	  alignment problem for the IT/OT closed form alignment
	- added methods in IAlignDetectorSelector for Lagrangian constraints
- in AlignmentTools v2r8
       	- added implementation of Centipede class, see AlignmentInterfaces for a descrpition.
	- reconstituted original call to InitMillepede in Millepede class

- in AlignTrTools v3r2
	- added implementation of TAConfig class. This class allows for a better split
	  between the tool (TAConfig) and the algorithm (GAlign)
	- updated Derivatives class

- in SolvKernel v1r1
	- nothing

- in AlignSolvTools v2r1
	- added ntuple with eigenvector information for monitoring
        - tools split into subtools with common interface
	- tools can be configured by user
- in TAlignment v3r2
	- 2007-08-30 - Johan Blouw
	 - re-organizing GAlign class by moving tool-related code to TAConfig class.
	 - added a linker library so that methods from GAlign can be called from
	   python
	 - added dictionaries for the above purpose
	 - added modifications to the requirements file accordingly
	 NOTE: this is not intended as a "best solution"; in a next release I'd
	 prefer to remove the linker library and the dictionaries.
	- 2007-08-16 - Gerhard Raven
	 - make sure the same pivot points are used consistently  in AlignAlgorithm
	 - add some more monitoring
	-  2007-08-16 - Jan Amoraal
	 - Add the option to strip hits from a track before re-fitting it.
	 - Move common code from AlignOTDetector to AlignmentFunctions
	 - Add support for (linear) Lagrange multipliers
	 - If no pivot points defined, use the 'local' (0,0,0) in global coordinates as default
	- 2007-07-20 - Jan Amoraal
	 - Added a small treack filter algorithm which filters tracks by type
	 - Update and corretly apply DetElem alignment deltas using Juan's geometry free functions
	 - Added a small alignment python script
	 - Made AlignOTDetector more generic by using templates
	 - Minor speed improvements and cleaning up
	 - Removed src/IAlignDetectorSelector.h since it has been moved to AlignmentInterfaces
	- 2007-05-15 Johan Blouw 
	  - removed *_load.cpp as it is not needed anymore

- in AlignT2Velo v1r1
	- removed unnecessary dependencies

- in Escher v2r2
	- redefined the calling sequence to reflect changes made by J. Amoraal
