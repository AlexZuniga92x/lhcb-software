** There was a problem introduced by J. Blouw. I did not realize that
   in fact AlignSolvKernel was replaced with AligKernel. So, I had removed
   AlignSolvTools... which was wrong. I have put it back, and retagged the
   AlignmentSys package with the same tag.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v4r0>2009-02-21 AlignmentSys v4r0</A></H1><PRE>
- General comments/remarks
	. introduced configurables for the following packages
		- Escher
		- TAlignment
		- AlignTrTools
	. some of the already existing python scripts have been moved around a bit
	  (e.g. from TAlignment/python to TAlignment/python/TAlignment, or TAlignment/options)
	. in cae of TAlignment, the linker library has been removed
	. The escher configurable is more or less a cc of the Brunel one,
	  with adaptations, changes etc where deemed necessary.
	. Note: for this release, only the Kalman sequence & the Millepede sequence for OT layers
          has been configured & tested. Rest will follow soon...
 	. I noticed a small problem in the Millepede sequence, which will be resolved later as well.
	  - here, the piece of code which is used to convert the alignment constants determined by Millepede 
	    into constants in the LHCb coordinate system seems to have a bug... certain conditions are not found.
	. a new package has been introduced, called "MisAligner". It produces an executable which can be used to 
	  easily generate misaligned xml files (which then have to be manually uploaded into your favourite conditions
	  databasse.
