Package: AlignmentSys
Package Coordinator: Johan Blouw
Purpose: LHCb Alignment packages.
         This project contains 2 different alignment algorithms
         used by the Gaudi application Escher to align the LHCb detector 
         components.

- Packages added: AlignT2Velo
- Packages update: AlignmentInterfaces 	v2r2
 		   AlignmentTools      	v2r8
		   AlignTrTools		v3r2
		   SolvKernel		v1r1
		   AlignSolvTools	v2r1
		   TAlignment		v3r2
		   AlignT2Velo		v1r1
		   Escher		v2r2

- in AlignmentInterfaces  v2r2
	- added Centipede interface which inherits from Millepede,
          to accomodate different use of it by IT/OT from Velo.
        - added ITAConfig interface, which is used to configure the
	  alignment problem for the IT/OT closed form alignment
	- added methods in IAlignDetectorSelector for Lagrangian constraints
- in AlignmentTools v2r8
       	- added implementation of Centipede class, see AlignmentInterfaces for a descrpition.
	- reconstituted original call to InitMillepede in Millepede class

- in AlignTrTools v3r2
	- added implementation of TAConfig class. This class allows for a better split
	  between the tool (TAConfig) and the algorithm (GAlign)
	- updated Derivatives class

- in SolvKernel v1r1
	- nothing

- in AlignSolvTools v2r1
	- added ntuple with eigenvector information for monitoring
        - tools split into subtools with common interface
	- tools can be configured by user
- in TAlignment v3r2
	- 2007-08-30 - Johan Blouw
	 - re-organizing GAlign class by moving tool-related code to TAConfig class.
	 - added a linker library so that methods from GAlign can be called from
	   python
	 - added dictionaries for the above purpose
	 - added modifications to the requirements file accordingly
	 NOTE: this is not intended as a "best solution"; in a next release I'd
	 prefer to remove the linker library and the dictionaries.
	- 2007-08-16 - Gerhard Raven
	 - make sure the same pivot points are used consistently  in AlignAlgorithm
	 - add some more monitoring
	-  2007-08-16 - Jan Amoraal
	 - Add the option to strip hits from a track before re-fitting it.
	 - Move common code from AlignOTDetector to AlignmentFunctions
	 - Add support for (linear) Lagrange multipliers
	 - If no pivot points defined, use the 'local' (0,0,0) in global coordinates as default
	- 2007-07-20 - Jan Amoraal
	 - Added a small treack filter algorithm which filters tracks by type
	 - Update and corretly apply DetElem alignment deltas using Juan's geometry free functions
	 - Added a small alignment python script
	 - Made AlignOTDetector more generic by using templates
	 - Minor speed improvements and cleaning up
	 - Removed src/IAlignDetectorSelector.h since it has been moved to AlignmentInterfaces
	- 2007-05-15 Johan Blouw 
	  - removed *_load.cpp as it is not needed anymore

- in AlignT2Velo v1r1
	- removed unnecessary dependencies

- in Escher v2r2
	- redefined the calling sequence to reflect changes made by J. Amoraal
