Package	:	Alignment/TAlignment
Package Coordinator	:	Jan Amoraal, Johan Blouw
Purpose	: collection of alignment algorithms

! 2007-10-15 - Louis Nicolas
 - GetElementsToAlign: added IT specific part to get IT stations, layers and boxes
 - TrackFilterAlg: changed interface to AlignSelTool track selector (now using TrackInterfaces/TrackSelector)

! 2007-10-15 - Johan Blouw
 - remove old tag, update package and retag TAlignment so that it can be part of ALIGNMENT_v2r1
 - NOTE: sometimes being practical supersedes being principal... (JB)

! 2007-10-12 - Jan Amoraal/H. Degaudenzi
 - Define boost functions explicitly in TrackFilterAlg.cpp (Jan Amoraal) to solve compiling problem on Windows OS.

! 2007-09-25 - Johan Blouw
 - removed several inconsistencies in AlignAlgorithm.cpp and AlignmentElement.h due to
   use of LHCB_v22r9
   - notably: calls to IGeometry used localDeltaParams changed to ownToOffNominalParams
              calls to IGeometry used localDeltaMatrix changed to ownToOffNominalMatrix
- NOTE: the package has been retagged for the soft project release.

! 2007-09-21 - Johan Blouw
 - modified requirements file such that only GAlign is
   visible to python through a linker library

! 2007-09-01 - Jan Amoraal
 - Added AlignmentElement and FindAlignment (Framework++)
 - Added a small testing algorithm

! 2007-08-30 - Johan Blouw
 - re-organizing GAlign class by moving tool-related code to TAConfig class.
 - added a linker library so that methods from GAlign can be called from
   python
 - added dictionaries for the above purpose
 - added modifications to the requirements file accordingly
 NOTE: this is not intended as a "best solution"; in a next release I'd 
 prefer to remove the linker library and the dictionaries.

! 2007-08-16 - Gerhard Raven
 - make sure the same pivot points are used consistently  in AlignAlgorithm
 - add some more monitoring

! 2007-08-16 - Jan Amoraal
 - Add the option to strip hits from a track before re-fitting it.
 - Move common code from AlignOTDetector to AlignmentFunctions
 - Add support for (linear) Lagrange multipliers
 - If no pivot points defined, use the 'local' (0,0,0) in global coordinates as default

! 2007-07-20 - Jan Amoraal
 - Added a small treack filter algorithm which filters tracks by type
 - Update and corretly apply DetElem alignment deltas using Juan's geometry free functions
 - Added a small alignment python script
 - Made AlignOTDetector more generic by using templates
 - Minor speed improvements and cleaning up
 - Removed src/IAlignDetectorSelector.h since it has been moved to AlignmentInterfaces

- Johan Blouw (same tag) 15/05/2007
  - removed *_load.cpp as it is not needed anymore

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r1>2007-05-14 TAlignment v3r1</A></H1><PRE>

- update requirements file for the software project release (J. Blouw)

- 2007-05-03 - Jan Amoraal
 - Update alignment constants (in memory)

- 2007-04-30 - Jan Amoraal
 - Solve system of linear eq. Ha=x using AlignSolvTools

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r0>2007-04-25 TAlignment v3r0</A></H1><PRE>
- 2007-04-25 - Johan Blouw
 - moved tool parts to AlignTrTools
 - moved interface to AlignmentInterfaces
 Contains now 3 algorithms:
  - AlignAlgorithm: Generic chi^2 minimisation algorithm
  - GAlign: performs alignment using Millepede for TT,OT & IT
  - TStation: algorithm to select tracks and store them in a dst

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r0>2007-03-29 TAlignment v2r0</A></H1><PRE>
- 2007-03-29 - Jan Amoraal
 - Fix includes

- 2007-03-19 - Jan Amoraal
 - Remove blah from requirements
  
- 2007-03-09 - Jan Amoraal
 - First version of the (T) Alignment Framework
 - AlignAlgorithm: Generic chi^2 minimisation algorithm
   IAlignDetectorSelector: Detector selector interface for alignment
   AlignOTDetector: Tool that provides information necessary for aligning the OT.
