  Small modification of version v2r0, fitglo() adapted to non-linear derivatives. A new option
  has also been added, which enable to fix the first element to align. This option could be used 
  when constraint equations are not appropriate (low number of elements).

  For an example of how to use it, see the VeloAlignment package (version v2r0 and higher).

  This release is also adapted to DC06 reconstruction software (LHCb v20r* and higher).

  Package has been tested with : LHCb   v21r2
                                 Brunel v30r5
