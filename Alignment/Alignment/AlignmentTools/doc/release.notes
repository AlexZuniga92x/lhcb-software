Package : AlignmentTools
Package Coordinator : Sebastien Viret
Purpose : provides a c++ translation of Volker Blobel's Millepede algorithm.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r6>2007-05-14 AlignmentTools v2r6</A></H1><PRE>
- 14/05/2007 - Johan Blouw     ** v2r6 **
  -> release for the software project
     - moved some info statements to debug statements

- 08/05/2007 - Johan Blouw     same version
  -> Made Millepede tool compliant to new way of declaring tools
     Small changes to print a bit more output

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r5>2007-04-15 AlignmentTools v2r5</A></H1><PRE>
- 25/04/2007 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r5 **

  -> Correction of a memory allocation problem. It only affects the method InitMille()
     which now has to have the number of fits as last argument in input. This number is 
     then used to resize the vectors that will contains the infos for iterations: storeare,
     storeind,... 

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r4>2007-03-07 AlignmentTools v2r4</A></H1><PRE>
- 07/03/2007 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r4 **

  -> Final modifications of the code in order to handle non-linear derivatives. The process
     is now generalized, and handled by 2 arrays: dernl (contains the global derivative
     related to a non-linear term) and dernl_i (contains the reference to the corresponding 
     non-linear term, ie the local parameter number). This new way of doing is illustrated in 
     a simple example available at the following address:

     http://ppewww.physics.gla.ac.uk/LHCb/VeloAlign/StandaloneCode.html

  -> Minor bug fixes in EquLoc method.

  -> The package has been tested on both slc3 and slc4 with Brunel v30r14
 

- 06/02/2007 - Johan Blouw  ** v2r4 **

  -> Added "#include math.h" in order to be able to compile & link on slc4

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r3>2006-12-13 AlignmentTools v2r3</A></H1><PRE>
- 13/12/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r3 **

  -> Memory allocation problems have been fixed, code speed has been optimized a little bit,
     in particular in FitLoc and Spavat methods (callgrind job showed that 75% of the time was spent
     in Spavat...)

  -> Options file has been removed (options should be set during the alignment process 
     (see VeloAlignment/v*/opts/VeloAlign.opts for an example)

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r2>2006-07-27 AlignmentTools v2r2</A></H1><PRE>
- 27/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r2 **

  -> Modification done for ACDC2 alignment. Option FirstFixed has been replaced by ModuleFixed. 
     It means that every module could now be fixed, just have to give its number in the otpions 
     file

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r3>2006-07-26 AlignmentTools v2r1</A></H1><PRE>
- 26/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r1 **

  -> Small modification of version v2r0, fitglo() adapted to non-linear derivatives. A new option
     has also been added, which enable to fix the first element to align. This option could be used 
     when constraint equations are not appropriate (low number of elements).

     For an example of how to use it, see the VeloAlignment package (version v2r0 and higher).

     This release is also adapted to DC06 reconstruction software (LHCb v20r* and higher).

     Package has been tested with : LHCb   v21r2
                                    Brunel v30r5

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r0>2006-01-18 AlignmentTools v2r0</A></H1><PRE>

- 18/01/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r0 **
  -> All informations specific to the have been suppressed from the package. This 
     one is now completely independant.

     For an example of how to use it, see the VeloAlignment package.

     Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                       Brunel v28r2

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v1r0>2006-01-16 AlignmentTools v1r0</A></H1><PRE>

- 16/01/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v1r0 **
  -> First release of the AlignmentTools package.

     Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                       Brunel v28r2
     Tools included:
          Millepede  - Millepede C++ translation 


  -> This package is intended to provide an interface to Millepede usable by the different 
     sub-detectors for their own alignment algorithm.
