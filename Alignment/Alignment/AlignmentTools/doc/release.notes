!=============================================================================
! 06/02/2007 - Johan Blouw  ** v2r4 **

Added "#include math.h" in order to be able to compile & link on slc4

!=============================================================================
! 13/12/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r3 **

  Memory allocation problems have been fixed, code speed has been optimized a little bit,
  in particular in FitLoc and Spavat methods (callgrind job showed that 75% of the time was spent
  in Spavat...)

  Options file has been removed (options should be set during the alignment process 
  (see VeloAlignment/v*/opts/VeloAlign.opts for an example)

!=============================================================================
! 27/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r2 **

  Modification done for ACDC2 alignment. Option FirstFixed has been replaced by ModuleFixed. 
	It means that every module could now be fixed, just have to give its number in the otpions 
	file

!=============================================================================
! 26/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r1 **

  Small modification of version v2r0, fitglo() adapted to non-linear derivatives. A new option
  has also been added, which enable to fix the first element to align. This option could be used 
  when constraint equations are not appropriate (low number of elements).

  For an example of how to use it, see the VeloAlignment package (version v2r0 and higher).

  This release is also adapted to DC06 reconstruction software (LHCb v20r* and higher).

  Package has been tested with : LHCb   v21r2
                                 Brunel v30r5

!=============================================================================
! 18/01/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r0 **
  All informations specific to the have been suppressed from the package. This 
  one is now completely independant.

  For an example of how to use it, see the VeloAlignment package.

  Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                    Brunel v28r2

!=============================================================================
! 16/01/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v1r0 **
  First release of the AlignmentTools package.

  Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                    Brunel v28r2
  Tools included:
       Millepede  - Millepede C++ translation 


This package is intended to provide an interface to Millepede usable by the different 
sub-detectors for their own alignment algorithm.
