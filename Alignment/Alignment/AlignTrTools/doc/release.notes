</PRE><H1><A NAME=v4r5>2010-02-05 AlignTrTools v4r5 </A></H1><PRE>
 - J. Blouw tagged the package v4r5 for alignment release v4r6

! 2010-02-05 Johan Blouw
  - modified the ATrackSelector, it now attempts to create a uniform distribution
    of tracks across the OT. Therefore, a method 'uniformTD' was added,
    and used inside 'accept' to do just that. Two new parameters were introduced:
    m_weights, to switch on/off this feature, and 
    m_uniCut (UniformCutOff). The algorithm accepts a track through module i,
    in case there are equal or more tracks going through module i-1.
    Note that module 8 is nearest the beampipe, and module 0 furthest. 
  - modified ATrackSelector.py to reflect the aforementioned changes.
  - modified the AlignTrTools Configurable for the same reasone.
  - modifed the Derivatives class so that it automagically sets the signs in the 
    derivatives according to the data (e.g. -1 for MC, +1 for data etc.)
  - removed a useless call in TAConfig (namely: TAConfig::Resolution)

! 2010-01-12 Wouter Hulsbergen
 - Add flag to remove pivot points when writing out xml. (True by default.)

! 2009-12-29 Johan Blouw
  - fixed several complaints by the slc5 compiler...

    ATrackSelector
    TAConfig
    Derivatives

  -> changes to AlignSelTool, AlignTrackMonitor, AlignSaveTuple by L. Nicolas, see below.


! 2007-10-31 - Louis Nicolas
 - In AlignSelTool, AlignTrackMonitor and AlignSaveTuple: changed the way nSharedHits is calculated to speed up things

! 2007-10-30 - Louis Nicolas
 - In AlignSelTool, AlignTrackMonitor and AlignSaveTuple: changed the way nNeighbouringHits is calculated to speed up things

! 2007-10-25 - Louis Nicolas
 - Added code AlignSaveTuple: saving various variables in an NTuple for further debugging analysis

! 2007-10-17 - Louis Nicolas
 - Few changes in AlignTrackMonitor to save residuals in a nicer way (+ use unbiasedResiduals)

! 2007-10-08 - Louis Nicolas
 	In AlignTrackMonitor:
	- Got rid of useless variables (or variables that don't make sense in histos)
	- Moved to GaudiHistoAlg: now save all the variables in histos. For residuals,
	  a sub-folder is created for IT and one for OT. Also, one sub-folder is
	  created for the ladder overlaps and a last one for the box overlaps.

	In AlignSelTool:
	- Now count numbers of LHCbIDs and not measurements to compute number of
	  missing hits (holes)
	- Added possibility to select tracks "randomly" in order to get a constant
	  illumination of the whole detector surface (based on the variable:
	  sqrt(tx**2+ty**2)).

  -> changed "double blahblah[n]" type of instantiations to "double *blahblah = new double[n]" to
     remain consistent with windows compiler.
