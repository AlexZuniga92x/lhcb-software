Package: Alignment/AlignTrTools
Package Coordinator : Johan Blouw
Responsibles : J. Amoraal, J. Blouw, A. Hicheur, L. Nicolas
Purpose: LHCb Alignment Tools

! 2008-05-27 - Marco Gersabeck
 - WriteAlignmentConditions: Added choice to select layers to be printed as needed by VELO. Default behaviour unchanged.

! 2008-05-21 - Louis Nicolas
 - AlignSelTool: added cuts on track eta and on number of IT and Velo clusters in event
 - AlignTrackMonitor and AlignSaveTuple: cleaned up a bit and added: track eta, # IT clusters and # Velo clusters

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r5>2008-05-15 AlignTrTools v3r5 </A></H1><PRE>
 - J. Blouw:  tagged v3r5 for alignment project software release v3r0

! 2008-05-15 - Johan Blouw
 - Florin implemented a new model for the global derivatives in the Derivatives class
   in addition, a model describing hits in a sensor has been added to that class.
 - Marc implemented a more general way to construct constraints for IT & OT
 - Florin & Marc implemented a more proper iterative procedure in the TAConfig class.
 - Johan added the possibility to cut on the energy deposit of the track in the calorimeters
   in the ATrackSelector class.
 - Florin & Johan added the possibility to store the M'pede calculated alignment parameters
   on the TES. This is subsequently used by Matt's WriteAlignmentConditions algorithm.

! 2008-03-15 - Louis Nicolas
 - added cut on track fit match chi2

! 2008-03-04 - Johan Blouw
  - added functionality to TAConfigTool class, such that the Millepede alignment parameters
    are now stored in a Transformation3D object which is subsequently stored in the transient
    cond db per detector element. 
  - Added code to TAConfigTool so that muon stations can also be aligned.
  - changes to the way the doca is calculated in TAConfigTool class. It now works for both
    OT/IT and Muon stations.
  - added Matt's "WriteAlignmentConditions" class to AlignTrTools package.
  

! 2008-02-06 - Louis Nicolas
 - Bug fix for the cut on the number of shared hits and close hits in AlignSelTool.cpp
 - Added Pt cut in AlignSelTool.cpp

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r3>2007-12-19 AlignTrTools v3r4 </A></H1><PRE>
- J. Blouw: new release for Alignment releae v2r3
  - tag v3r4, incorporates changes listed below


! 2007-12-10 - Louis Nicolas
 - fixed Initialize/Finalize misbalance for ATrackSelector
 - fixed a bug in getCloseHits method in Align{SelTool,SaveTuple,TrackMonitor}.cpp

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r3>2007-11-09 AlignTrTools v3r3 </A></H1><PRE>
- J. Blouw, 2007-11-09
  -> tagged head of AlignTrTools to v2r3
  -> changes to AlignSelTool, AlignTrackMonitor, AlignSaveTuple by L. Nicolas, see below.


! 2007-10-31 - Louis Nicolas
 - In AlignSelTool, AlignTrackMonitor and AlignSaveTuple: changed the way nSharedHits is calculated to speed up things

! 2007-10-30 - Louis Nicolas
 - In AlignSelTool, AlignTrackMonitor and AlignSaveTuple: changed the way nNeighbouringHits is calculated to speed up things

! 2007-10-25 - Louis Nicolas
 - Added code AlignSaveTuple: saving various variables in an NTuple for further debugging analysis

! 2007-10-17 - Louis Nicolas
 - Few changes in AlignTrackMonitor to save residuals in a nicer way (+ use unbiasedResiduals)

! 2007-10-08 - Louis Nicolas
 	In AlignTrackMonitor:
	- Got rid of useless variables (or variables that don't make sense in histos)
	- Moved to GaudiHistoAlg: now save all the variables in histos. For residuals,
	  a sub-folder is created for IT and one for OT. Also, one sub-folder is
	  created for the ladder overlaps and a last one for the box overlaps.

	In AlignSelTool:
	- Now count numbers of LHCbIDs and not measurements to compute number of
	  missing hits (holes)
	- Added possibility to select tracks "randomly" in order to get a constant
	  illumination of the whole detector surface (based on the variable:
	  sqrt(tx**2+ty**2)).

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r2>2007-04-25 AlignTrTools v3r2 </A></H1><PRE>
- J. Blouw, 2007-09-26
  -> made TAConfig consistent with IGeometry & IAlignment interface of DetDesc v18r0
  -> changed "double blahblah[n]" type of instantiations to "double *blahblah = new double[n]" to
     remain consistent with windows compiler.
  -> NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!
===> RETAG of this package, due to inconsistencies with LHCB_v22r9

! 2007-09-20 - Louis Nicolas

 In AlignSelTool:
	- Removed obsolete parts
	- Removed hard-coded constants and defined them using the geometry
	- Added incident listener for not getting tracks and clusters containers for
	  each track
	- Added cut on multiplicity
	- Added possibility to select tracks going through:
		- IT only
		- OT only
		- IT / OT overlap region
		- Any IT box overlap
		- A defined IT box overlap
		- The same IT box in all stations
		- The same ladder of the same IT box in all stations
		- The same OT quarter in all stations
		- The same module of the same OT quarter in all stations
	- Now uses nExpectedIT/OT track info to get the number of missing hits (holes)

 In AlignTrackMonitor:
	- Removed obsolete parts
	- Added ghost classification
	- Removed hard-coded constants and defined them using the geometry
	- Greatly simplified the calculation of the number of missing hits (holes) by
	  using the nExpectedIT/OT track info
	- Changed a few variables in the ntuple
