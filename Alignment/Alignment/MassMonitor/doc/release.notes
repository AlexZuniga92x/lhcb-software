! Package     : Alignment/MassMonitor
! Responsible : Jack Wimberley
! Purpose     : Package for making fits to 2D histograms (mass vs. VARIABLE)

- Added MassBiasesMonitor, which reproduces most of the functionality
	of TrackParticleMonitor but without the TrackStateVertex fit
	and adds a 2D histogram of mass vs. run
- The bins for runs are by default by a string in the file,
	taken from Maurizio's IOV definitions and the operations Dashboard
- This can be overridden with the property IOVData, which should be
	passed a string of the same format (mock tab-delimited file)

- Arithmetic fixes in calculating bin centers/widths

! 2013-04-04 - Jack Wimberley
- Initial working version
- Meant to streamline processes described in Needham et al
  (LHCb-INT-2011-012) and Amhis et al (LHCb-INT-2011-013)
- Meant to be used in conjunction with TrackParticleMonitor,
  to get plots of mass position/resolution vs. mom, momasym, etc
- Later a tool to look at mass position/resolution vs. time will be added
- Support for Jpsi -> mu mu, Ups(1S) -> mu mu, Z0 -> mu mu
- Still room for improvement in model PDFs
- Still need for fallback PDFs in case of low statistics
- Support for other decays (D0 -> K pi, etc.) will be added later
