- Arithmetic fixes in calculating bin centers/widths

! 2013-04-04 - Jack Wimberley
- Initial working version
- Meant to streamline processes described in Needham et al
  (LHCb-INT-2011-012) and Amhis et al (LHCb-INT-2011-013)
- Meant to be used in conjunction with TrackParticleMonitor,
  to get plots of mass position/resolution vs. mom, momasym, etc
- Later a tool to look at mass position/resolution vs. time will be added
- Support for Jpsi -> mu mu, Ups(1S) -> mu mu, Z0 -> mu mu
- Still room for improvement in model PDFs
- Still need for fallback PDFs in case of low statistics
- Support for other decays (D0 -> K pi, etc.) will be added later
