! Package     : VeloAlignment
! Responsible : Sebastien Viret

! 26/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r0 **

  Lots of majors changes in this new version:

  * This version now includes both STEP1 (internal alignment by tracks) and STEP2
	(box alignment with primary vertices and (or) overlaps) alignment. This implies mainly
	changes in Milleconfig and TrackStore. 

  * This is also the first version fully adapted to all DC06 changes (new TEM,...).

  * Alignment monitoring via NTuple has been improved. There is now the possibility to get 
	a independant sample of 1000 tracks in order to check the residuals. Monitoring ntuples
	could be requested via joboptions file. 

  * Options files have been slightly simplified and are fully commented

  However this version is still a preliminary one (in part. for STEP2) and is mainly
	dedicated to ACDC system tests.

! 01/02/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v1r0 **

  First release of the VELO Alignment package.

  This package uses the Millepede Alignment Tool. To do so it takes Track objects
  and transform them into AlignTrack which is a 'Millepede-friendly' class of track.

  This transformation is done via a TrackStore tool. Then Millepede is feeded using
  a MilleConfig object, which makes the interface with Millepede.

  Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                    Brunel v28r2
