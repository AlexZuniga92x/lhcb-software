! 01/02/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v1r0 **

  First release of the VELO Alignment package.

  This package uses the Millepede Alignment Tool. To do so it takes Track objects
  and transform them into AlignTrack which is a 'Millepede-friendly' class of track.

  This transformation is done via a TrackStore tool. Then Millepede is feeded using
  a MilleConfig object, which makes the interface with Millepede.

  Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                    Brunel v28r2
