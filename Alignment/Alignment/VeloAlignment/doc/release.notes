! Package     : VeloAlignment
! Responsible : Sebastien Viret


!=============================================================================
! 26/04/2007 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r4 **

  New optimisation of the code. In particular, the AlignTrack.xml file has been
  replaced by a simpler VeloTrack.h class, now sitting in /src/ directory.

  This version NEEDS 'AlignmentTools v2r5' or higher to work. A new memory 
  allocation technique has been setup. 


!=============================================================================
! 07/03/2007 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r3 **

  This release presents the final version of boxes alignment, mixing primary vertices 
  and overlaps in one single fit. It needs the latest version of Millepede (v2r4),
  with the new non-linear treatment. Major modifications are in Milleconfig.cpp method.

  Information on 'how-to' run this code (including analysis macros), might be found 
  at the following address:

!=============================================================================
! 19/09/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r2 **

  Modifications mainly in TrackStore.cpp. Misalignments contained in the XmlConditions
  are now fully taken into account during the alignment process. So now, if you
  run the code on misaligned data with the correct alignment.xml file, you should
  end up with zero misalignments.

  Also few minor bug fixes, and warning messages removed.


!=============================================================================
! 27/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r1 **

  Minor change in the jobOptions files. The number of track in the sample used to
	monitor the residuals could now be set in AlignmentMonitor.opts

  This version uses version v2r2 of AlignmentTools.

!=============================================================================
! 26/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r0 **

  Lots of majors changes in this new version:

  * This version now includes both STEP1 (internal alignment by tracks) and STEP2
	(box alignment with primary vertices and (or) overlaps) alignment. This implies mainly
	changes in Milleconfig and TrackStore. 

  * This is also the first version fully adapted to all DC06 changes (new TEM,...).

  * Alignment monitoring via NTuple has been improved. There is now the possibility to get 
	a independant sample of 1000 tracks in order to check the residuals. Monitoring ntuples
	could be requested via joboptions file. 

  * Options files have been slightly simplified and are fully commented

  However this version is still a preliminary one (in part. for STEP2) and is mainly
	dedicated to ACDC system tests.

!=============================================================================
! 01/02/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v1r0 **

  First release of the VELO Alignment package.

  This package uses the Millepede Alignment Tool. To do so it takes Track objects
  and transform them into AlignTrack which is a 'Millepede-friendly' class of track.

  This transformation is done via a TrackStore tool. Then Millepede is feeded using
  a MilleConfig object, which makes the interface with Millepede.

  Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                    Brunel v28r2
