First Full release of MooreOnline.

Moore Online depends on Moore v22r0 and Online v5r7.

New Features:
  - All Moore's online-specific components have been migrated.
  - A new configurable, MooreOnline() holds online-specific configurations
  - A new package, MooreOnlineConf holds this configurable.
  - This configurable is very specific to the online environment, but simple tests
    are already performed to check it in principle should work...
  - The installer script, and testing the installer script, has been added to
    MooreScripts/install/, so it is tracked and versioned through svn

Second prototype release of MooreOnline, the online wrapper project for Moore.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v20r4>2013-10-30 MooreOnlineSys v20r4</A></H1><PRE>

First release of the Online wrapper project for Moore. MooreOnline has the same version as the underlying Moore version for simplicity/transparency.

It's a project which can be used in teh nightlies to test that running Moore works in the online environment. It can also hold online-specific code. I imagine moving all the online-specific parts of Moore into this project.

Only package so far: MoroeScripts to hold the setup scripts.
