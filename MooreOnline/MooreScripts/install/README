This simple directory contains the installation scripts to install Moore in the online environment.

You are not expected to getpack MooreScripts to run these installers, but instead you are expected to simply checkout the directory from svn.

svn checkout `svnpath MooreScripts head`/install install

The only reason this is in svn is so that we can track the changes made to this script, so please *do track the changes made to this script!* by editing the release.notes and choosing an extensive commit message.

Contents:
- InstallMoore.sh
- test_install.sh
- checkPath.py
- README
- release.notes

InstallMoore.sh:
 - script for installing Moore (MooreOnline) on the local cluster.
 - you do not need any previously setup environment to use this script
 - you do not need to edit this script, there are options for everything
 - for example --cmtconfig <cmtconfig>
 - InstallMoore.sh #no options prints the help and exits

testinstall.sh
 - script for mimicking the online installation environment for testing 
   if the installer works or not as provided.
 - you may need to edit this script for your local use, 
   to select which version of Moore to test, etc.

checkPath.py
 - used by InstallMoore to check the order of LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH
 - must live in same directory as InstallMoore.sh
