This simple directory contains the installation scripts to install Moore in the online environment.

You are not expected to getpack MooreScripts to run these installers, but instead you are expected to simply checkout the directory from svn.

svn checkout `svnpath MooreScripts head`/install install

The only reason this is in svn is so that we can track the changes made to this script, so please *do track the changes made to this script!* by editing the release.notes and choosing an extensive commit message.

Contents:
- InstallMoore.sh
