!============================== DaVinciTests v1r1p1 2010-08-03 ===============

! 2010-08-03 - Juan Palacios
 - tests/qmtest/davinci.qms/stripping.qms/test_bd2kstarmumu_mc09.qmt
  . Update efficiencies for early signal line.
 - Increase to v1r1p1.

!============================== DaVinciTests v1r1 2010-07-08 =================

! 2010-07-08 - Juan Palacios
 - Imported test_strippingconf.qmt and test_strippingline.qmt from Phys/StrippingConf.

! 2010-06-27 - Juan Palaciosn
 - test/options/DVTestDecayTreeTuple.py
  . Tuple had hard-wired InputLocations and was thus failing with latest 
    StrippingConf. Get location from stripping line directly.

! 2010-06-21 - Juan Palacios
 - Removed tests/qmtest/davinci.qms/stripping.qms/test_realdata.qmt
  . Covered by other stripping tests and getting out of date.

! 2010-06-16
 - tests/qmtest/davinci.qms/fsrs.qms/davinci-strip-magup.qmt
 - tests/qmtest/davinci.qms/fsrs.qms/davinci-strip-magdown.qmt
  . Run over all events in input. Add some tests to check for FATALs.

! 2010-06-14 - Juan Palacios
 - Rename output file in options after the main ones, trying to replicate
   production extra-options structure.
 - Increase to v1r1.

!============================== DaVinciTests v1r0 2010-06-13 =================

! 2010-06-11 - Rob Lambert
 - Fix merge test such that it just looks for AppMgr success.
 - Add v0 (full) and radiative (empty) streams, merged/tested in parallel

! 2010-06-10 - Rob Lambert
 - Added FSR propagation tests
