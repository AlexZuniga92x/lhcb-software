 This is the code reference manual for the LHCb Analysis Packages. 
 These pages have been generated directly from the code and reflect the
 exact state of the software. 

 Details specific to the Physics Libraries and Application will be 
 available in a DaVinci User Guide currently in preparation.
  
 For general features common to any LHCb GAUDI-based application you should
 consult the 
 <a href="http://lhcb-comp.web.cern.ch/lhcb-comp/Frameworks/Gaudi"> 
 LHCb General Framework Web page</a>.

 Use the links in the menu at the top of the page to navigate. In particular,
 the list of classes can be found <a href="annotated.html">here</a> or via
