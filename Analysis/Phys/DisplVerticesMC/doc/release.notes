! Package     : Phys/DisplVerticesMC
! Responsible : Neal Gauvin
! Purpose     : Offline algorithms and tools for the selection
!               of events with exotic displaced vertices (MC-dependent code)

! ======================= DisplVerticesMC v1r1 2010-11-02 ====================

! 2010-10-25 - Neal Gauvin
 - Propagate modifications done in DisplVertices
 - Modification of the upstream PV selection (in +/- 400mm), and keep selecting it when cutting on 
   beamline distance (avoid DV backward PV)
   New cut on material, moving with the halfbox frame introduced
   R wrt beam line stored in extra info 52 and is in material stored in extra info 51

! ======================= DisplVerticesMC v1r0 2010-10-04 ====================

! 2010-09-20 - Neal Gauvin
 - MC-dependent code of the Phys/DisplVertices v6r11 has been moved here.
	Please refer to the releases.notes of this package for details about 
	prior versions.
 - MCDisplVertices essentially loops on the candidates Particle and 
	applies cuts.
     * Successful candidates can be saved in TES.
     * Basic properties of successful candidates can be saved in a tuple.
     * Provide "purity" infos of the candidate.
