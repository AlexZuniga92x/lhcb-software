! Package     : DaVinciAssociators
! Responsible : Philippe Charpentier

!==============================================================================
! 20020517 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Changed the name of the associators following discussions
     Particle2MCAsct : 2 algorithms Particle2MCChi2 and Particle2MCLinks
   - New Associator
     Particle2MCWithChi2Asct : filled with Particle2MCWithChi2
     This is a "weighted" associator which uses the best chi2 as weight
     Particle2MCChi2 uses this associator as input and simply makes a cut

!==============================================================================
! 20020510 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Example on how to use two different algorithms with the same
      associator (with Chi2 or with links to AxPartCandidates)
   - Changed naming of algorithms to be shorter:
      Part2MCChi2 (default)
      Part2MCLink
   - Part2MCLink not tested until DaVinci v4r0 is available in CVS

!==============================================================================
! 20020425 - DaVinciAssociators v1r0 (Ph.Charpentier)

  - Example on how to set up an associator from Particle to MCParticle
    (Part2MCPartAsct.h)
	- Example of an algorithm to instantiate the above associator
    An example on how to retrieve information can be found in Phys/DavinciTest
