! Package     : DaVinciAssociators
! Responsible : Philippe Charpentier

!================= DaVinciAssociators v3r1 2003-01-06 ======================
                    join v3r0b branch
! 2003-01-06 - Florence Ranjard
 - requirements - use LHCb v11r5

!================= DaVinciAssociators v3r0p1 2002-11-08 ===================
                     built on v3r0b branch
! 2002-11-08 - Markus Frank
 - DaVinciAssociators_load.cpp - fix for new Gaudi version.

! 2002-11-06 - Florence Ranjard
 - requirements - use new versions

!================= DaVinciAssociators v3r0 2002-10-30 ======================
! 2002-10-14 - Gloria Corti
 - Use PreLoadParticles in TestAssociator and make it self-contained.

! 2002-10-11 - Gloria Corti
 - Uncomment options for a generic ChargedPP2MC associator 

! 2002-10-10 - Gloria Corti
 - Changes to compile and run on Windows
   - remove AsctAlgorithm:: in AsctAlgorithm.h 
   - introduce missing std:: in CompositeParticlesLink.h and TestAssociators
   - move declaration outside for()
   - add CompositeParticlesLinks to DaVinciAssociators_load
 - Adapt to coding convention indentations in CompositeParticlesLinks
 - Modify CompositeParticlesLinks options to adapt to changes
 - Introduce CompositeParticlesLinks in DaVinciAssociators.opts

! 2002-10-09 - Gloria Corti
 - Modify CompositeParticle2MCLinks to have Particle2MCLinks as weighted
   given modifications in Particle2MCLinks, introduce shortcut name of
   used associator

! 2002-09-30 - Philippe Charpentier
 - Add CompositeParticle2MCLinks associator (G.Raven)
 - Add NeutralPP2MC associator (I.Belyaev)
 - Change name for ProtoParticle2MC associator to ChargedPP2MC (as there is
   now a NeutralPP2MC
 - Create options files for each concrete associator (i.e. one per algorithm)
 - Use dedicated associators "WithChi2" for "Chi2" Asct and of
   "ChargedPP2MC" for "Particle2MCLinks"
 - Include TestAssociators algorithm (from DaVinciTest package)

! 2002-09-12 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce Neutral ProtoParticle Associator from I.Belyaev

! 2002-09-09 - Gloria Corti
 - Introdude additional location in ProtoParticle2MCLinks for Upstream
   charged ProtoP (D.Hutchcroft)
 - Use PhysEvent v7r0 and increase version number to v3r0 in requirements

! 2002-09-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - in Particle2MCLinks, register the produced table only once in the TES 
   when specifying more than one 'source' of particles to be associated

!================= DaVinciAssociators v2r0 2002-07-29 ======================
! 2002-07-27 - Gloria Corti
 - add some std:: adn move template in body of class to compile on window
 - move template implementation in body of AsctAlgorithm to compile on 
   window

! 2002-07-18 - Gloria Corti
 - Use PhysEvent v6r* and remove use of EventSys

! 2002-07-17 - Philippe Charpentier
 - Transform Particle2MCLinks in order to use the ProtoParticle2MC associator
 - Base class AsctAlgorithm in order to implement standard Properties and a
    templated method for setting up a Private auxiliary associator
    retrievePrivateAsct(...) which defines privat tool, alg and Location.
    This avoid interference with default or user defined associators of same
    type

! 2002-07-15 - Philippe Charpentier
 - Property "InputData" of associators now a vector of strings, allowing
    more than one input location
 - Property "OutputData" changed to "OutputTable"
 - New associator for OO-DST: ProtoParticle2MCAsct for associations between 
    ProtoParticles and MCParticles. Implemented for charged tracks only
 - Associator from ZEBRA links still present for backward compatibility, will
    eventually be removed
 - Chi2 algorithm uses now its own instance of a "WithChi2" associator, as an
    example on how to do this and set correctly the properties. This allows
    the use of multiple instances of the Chi2 associator if needed...

!================= DaVinciAssociators v1r0p1 2002-06-07 ====================
! 2002-06-07 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove explicit requirement on LHCbKernel v1r0

!================= DaVinciAssociators v1r0 2002-06-05 ======================
! 20020517 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Changed the name of the associators following discussions
     Particle2MCAsct : 2 algorithms Particle2MCChi2 and Particle2MCLinks
   - New Associator
     Particle2MCWithChi2Asct : filled with Particle2MCWithChi2
     This is a "weighted" associator which uses the best chi2 as weight
     Particle2MCChi2 uses this associator as input and simply makes a cut

!==============================================================================
! 20020510 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Example on how to use two different algorithms with the same
      associator (with Chi2 or with links to AxPartCandidates)
   - Changed naming of algorithms to be shorter:
      Part2MCChi2 (default)
      Part2MCLink
   - Part2MCLink not tested until DaVinci v4r0 is available in CVS

!==============================================================================
! 20020425 - DaVinciAssociators v1r0 (Ph.Charpentier)

  - Example on how to set up an associator from Particle to MCParticle
    (Part2MCPartAsct.h)
	- Example of an algorithm to instantiate the above associator
    An example on how to retrieve information can be found in Phys/DavinciTest
