! Package     : DaVinciAssociators
! Responsible : Philippe Charpentier

! 2002-07-12 - Philippe Charpentier
 - Property "InputData" of associators now a vector of strings, allowing
    more than one input location
 - Property "OutputData" changed to "OutputTable"
 - New associator for OO-DST: ProtoParticle2MCAsct for associations between 
    ProtoParticles and MCParticles. Implemented for charged tracks only
 - Associator from ZEBRA links still present for backward compatibility, will
    eventually be removed
 - Chi2 associator using now its own instance of WithChi2 associator, as an
    example on how to do this and set correctly the properties.

! 2002-06-07 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove explicit requirement on LHCbKernel v1r0

! 20020517 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Changed the name of the associators following discussions
     Particle2MCAsct : 2 algorithms Particle2MCChi2 and Particle2MCLinks
   - New Associator
     Particle2MCWithChi2Asct : filled with Particle2MCWithChi2
     This is a "weighted" associator which uses the best chi2 as weight
     Particle2MCChi2 uses this associator as input and simply makes a cut

!==============================================================================
! 20020510 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Example on how to use two different algorithms with the same
      associator (with Chi2 or with links to AxPartCandidates)
   - Changed naming of algorithms to be shorter:
      Part2MCChi2 (default)
      Part2MCLink
   - Part2MCLink not tested until DaVinci v4r0 is available in CVS

!==============================================================================
! 20020425 - DaVinciAssociators v1r0 (Ph.Charpentier)

  - Example on how to set up an associator from Particle to MCParticle
    (Part2MCPartAsct.h)
	- Example of an algorithm to instantiate the above associator
    An example on how to retrieve information can be found in Phys/DavinciTest
