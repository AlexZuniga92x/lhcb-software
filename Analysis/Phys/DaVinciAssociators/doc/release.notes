  EXPERIMENTAL VERSION

  Major changes so Particle2MCLinker implementation.
  Linkers are now type-safe. For reverse-association to work, it is necessary
  that the Object2MCLinker class knows the SOURCE (typically Particle or 
  ProtoParticle) for links with key. Previously it was treating everything as 
  KeyedObject<int>. As a result:

  1. class Object2MClinker 

     is now 

     template <class SOURCE=LHCb::Particle> 
     class Object2MCLinker

  2. template <class OBJ2MCP=LHCb::Particle> 
     class Object2FromMC : public Object2MCLinker

     is now

     template <class OBJ2MCP=LHCb::Particle>
     class Object2FromMC : public Object2MCLinker<OBJ2MCP>

  3. implementation file src/Lib/Particle2MCLinker.cpp now is templated so is
     moved to DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.icpp and included in 
     DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.h

  4. There is no linker library now.

    The typedefs Particle2MCLinker and ProtoParticle2MCLinker retain ther 
    old meaning:

    typedef Object2FromMC<LHCb::ProtoParticle> ProtoParticle2MCLinker;
    typedef Object2FromMC<>                    Particle2MCLinker;

    

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v6r3 2006-10-17  ==============

! 2006-10-16 - Vanya BELYAEV
 1) src/NeutralPP2MC.cpp 
     - get the location of output table directly from 
       LHCb::ProtoParticle2MCLocation::Neutrals
 2) src/ChargedPP2MC.cpp
     - small reshuffling of lines to create one relation table 
       per linker object ( per one cointainer of protoparticles)
       Such coherency is easier to debug 
     - linker object/relation table is always created/registred
 3) options/NeutralPP2MC.opts
     - update the configuration of Data-On-Demand Service 
 4) options/ChargedPP2MC.opts
     - update the configuration of Data-On-Demand Service 


! 2006-10-11 - Juan PALACIOS
  - DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.h
    . Moved Particle2MCMethod namespace to DaVinciMCKernel.

  - cmt/requirements
    . Increase version number to v6r3

! 2006-10-11 - Olivier Deschamps

  - src/NeutralPP2MC.{cpp,opts}    Adapt to change in CaloAssociators
  - Add dependency to CaloUtils (standard definition of Calo relation tables in Calo2MC.h)

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v6r2 2006-10-04  ==============

! 2006-08-18 - Juan PALACIOS
  - src/ChargedPP2MC.cpp, NeutralPP2MC.cpp
    . Change definition of TES location of output relations tables from
      literal definition to that defined in new DaVinciKernel file
      Kernel/PP2MCLocation.h.
      New locations conform to agreed convention:
      LHCb::ProtoParticle2MCLocation::Charged = "Relations/" + LHCb::ProtoParticleLocation::Charged ;
      LHCb::ProtoParticle2MCLocation::Neutrals = "Relations/" + LHCb::ProtoParticleLocation::Neutrals ;


! 2006-08-02 - Philippe Charpentier
  - src/Particle2MCWithChi2.cpp
    . added debug information (conditioned by DEBUG_COV) for debugging covariance matrices
  - DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.h
    . added missing constructors for Obect2FromMC<T> when used in a GaudiTool

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v6r1 2006-07-28  ==============

! 2006-07-20 - Juan PALACIOS
  - src/Particle2MCWithChi2.cpp
    . Small changes and bug-fixes for SMatrix 5.12

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v6r0 2006-06-09  = =============

 - WARNING : major changes, see below
 - Remove Asct tools (as there is no longer Relation tools)
 - Remove building of Relations tables for Particle2MCParticle, keep for ProtoParticle2MCParticle (for LoKi compatibility)
 - Adapt "WithChi2" association to the new event model
 - Rename Linker objects (and header file) from xxxLink to xxxLinker in order to avoid confusion with association by Links
    New object names: Particle2MCLinker and ProtoParticle2MCLinker (in header file Particle2MCLinker.h). Templated objects are 
    called now Object2MCLinker (one direction link) and Object2FromMC<class OBJ2MCP=LHCb::Particle>

! 2005-05-09 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - src/NeutralPP2MC.cpp
   1) remove associator-related properties and 
      introduce the direct manupulations with relation table.
   2) New property "MCCaloTable" is introduced,
      the default value is "Rec/Relations/EcalClusters2MCParticles"
      It is compatible with "old" (including RTTC) data 
      For "new" data (DaVinci v14r*?)
      (with new treatment of Calo->MC relations, 
      the value of properties need to be set to 
      "Rec/Relations/CaloClusters2MCParticles"
   3) remove the bulk of debug/verbose printout 
   4) few "cosmetic" changes 
   5) Modify the treatment of invalid input: 
       for missing container of protoparticles, the defualt policy of 
       method GaudiAlgorithm::get is used (exception)
   6) improve comments for Doxygen

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r3p1 2005-04-20 ===================
! 2005-04-12 - Ph.Charpentier
 - DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLink.h 
    Fix a bug when calling createLinks for reverse associators
 - src/Lib/Particle2MCLink.cpp
    If the string /Particles is not at the end of the container name, add it

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r3 2005-02-15 ===================
! 2005-02-01 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/Particle2MCLinks.cpp
   . < myLink = LinkedTo<MCParticle>( evtSvc(), msgSvc(), TrgTrackLocation::Long );
     > myLink = LinkedTo<MCParticle>( evtSvc(), msgSvc(), TrgTrackLocation::Particle );
     Allows to use VTT TrgTracks also for association.
!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r2p2 2005-01-18 ===================
! 2005-01-12 - P. Koppenburg
 - actually remove the obsolete files!
!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r2p1 2004-12-01 ===================
! 2004-11-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - options/TestAssociators.opts
   . Renamed as DVTestAssociators.opts
! 2004-11-16 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/Particle2MCLink.cpp
   . Small hack to suppress the annoying message 
     "cannot find container /Trg/Long..."
!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r2 2004-09-16===================
! 2004-09-16 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/Particle2MCLink.cpp
   . Temporary hack suggested by Olivier Callot that solved the TrgTrack association
     problem. Not a definitive solution as it involes the hard-codeing of the 
     container. A better solution is being implemented in the TrgParticleMaker.     
! 2004-09-16 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/Particle2MCLink.cpp
   . Try to check if origin() is a TrgTrack if it is not a ProtoParticle.
     This does not allow yet to associate TrgTracks as they are not 
     stored in a container at creation. 
!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r1 2004-08-03 ===================
! 2004-08-03 - Ph. Charpentier
 - src/CompositeParticle2MCLinks.cpp
    . Fix a problem due to the fact that particles used to compose another may not 
      be in the same container, and may be in a container that is not declared (new
      PhysSel convention for containers)
    . Fix a bug in the code that prevented the composite particles associations to be 
      recorded in the Relations table (duplicate variable)
 - src/AsctAlgorithm.*
    . Added method to print the <path>/<key> of an object and use it in the algorithms
         std::string objectName(KeyedObject obj)
 - src/NeutralPP2MC.cpp
    . Problem noticed there as charged tracks like the B are associated to photons
      Being checked and fix put in the next release
! 2004-07-28 - Ph. Charpentier
 - src/Particle2MCLinksAsct.cpp & .h
    . Fix a bug for overwriting the incident handler in order to clear the
      local relations table

   . Don't use but import AIDA
!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r0p1 2004-07-22 ===================
! 2004-07-22 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/TestAssociators.opts, TestLinker.opts
    . Include DaVinciElectrons.opts

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r0 2004-06-28 ===================
! 2004-06-17 - Ph.Charpentier
  - Particle2MCLink.h and .cpp : add method
    bool checkAssociation( const KeyedObject*, const MCParticle*)
    to check if an object has any association with a given MCParticle

! 2004-06-16 - P. Koppenburg
  - DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCAsct.h
  - DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLink.h
  - DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCWithChi2Asct.h
    . Replace forward declarations by proper header file. This caused
      compilation problems depending on the order of includes.
    . locateAlgorithm( const std::string& algType, const std::string& algType,...
      in declaration compiles on linux, but not on windows.

! 2004-05-18 - Ph.Charpentier
 - New files DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLink.h src/Particle2MCLink.cpp
   Contains two classes: 
      Object2MCLink for direct links to MCParticles of any KeyedObject
      Object2FromMCLink<T> that includes reverse links, 
          hence must specifiy the real KeyedObject type as template
   ... and typedef shortcuts
   typedef Object2FromMCLink<Particle>      Particle2MCLink;
   typedef Object2FromMCLink<ProtoParticle> ProtoParticle2MCLink;
   These helper classes wrap the LinkedTo/From objects and call the creation 
     algorithm whenever necessary:

   #include "DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLink.h"
   in initialize():
   m_link = new <xxx>2MCLink( this, Particle2MCMethod::<method>, 
                                 containerList)
      <xxx> can be Object, Particle, ProtoParticle
      <method> is any of Composite / Links / Chi2 / WithChi2
      containerList is a vector of strings giving the Particles containers to
        be linked to MCParticles. There is also a constructor from a string
        for a single container.
      If your algorithm is a GaudiAlgorithm, Particle2MCLink is instrumented
        for printing messages
   in execute()
   Particle* part = ...
   MCParticle* mcPart = m_link->firstMCP( part );
   while( NULL != mcPart ) {
          .....
     weight = m_link->weightMCP()
          .....
     mcPart = m_link->nextMCP();
   }
   in finalize()
   if( NULL != m_link ) delete m_link;

   Convention for the name of the table:
      /Event/Link/<ParticleContainerName>/<method>
   Convention for the name of the algorithm run to create Link tables
      <parentAlg>.<creationAlgorithm>
      where <creationAlgorithm> is usually "Particle2MC<method>"
   There are many other methods available, please refer to Doxigen.
     In particular there is a constructor that takes an algType and container
     name extension as arguments, allowing a very general use of this class
     <xxx>2MCLink( this, algType, extension, containerList)
   Note that if a particle is NOT in a container, it cannot be associated using
     this method. Use the former Particle2MCLinksAsct tool instead
   If a particle is in a container that is not in the initial list, this list
     is updated and the InputData property of the algorithm updated 
     accordingly. Hence in principle you could start from an empty list...
 - All algorithms Particle2MCLinks, Particle2MCChi2, CompositeParticle2MCLinks
     adapted for using the Linkers and producing linker tables
 - AsctAlgorithm inherits from GaudiAlgorithm in order to benefit from it.
   Only added value is m_inputData and m_outputTable properties, i.e. not much

                        reconstructed decay.
      - maxResonanceLifeTime: Boundary to determine whether MCParticle 
                              should be considered as resonance.

 - CompositeParticle2MCLinks.cpp
      - For composite particles, checks whether their daughters are in the
        associated range rather than equal to "the" associated MCParticle
        (needed for neutrals that have many associations)
 - AsctAlgorithm.h : move to ./src as no need to expose it
 - TestAssociators : adapt for testing with neutrals and composite
 - NeutralPP2MC.opts: add options with the default tool name and include 
   the calorimeter options for CaloClusters association
! 2003-05-12 - Philippe Charpentier
 - CompositeParticle2MCLinks.cpp:
      - Use AsctAlgorithm features to transmit the input data Property to the 
        Links associator and give it a unique name...
      - Returns the MCParticle with most hits common with the track

!================= DaVinciAssociators v4r0 2003-04-24 ======================
! 2003-04-24 - Gloria Corti
 - CompositeParticle2MCLinks.h/.cpp - Introduce property AllowExtraPhotons to
   allow in MC Particle decay tree to have a missing photon when associating
   to a composite reconstructed particle.
   This is usefull for reconstructed J/Psi -> l+ l- where there can be a gamma
   in the MCTruth. (Yuehong Xie)

! 2003-04-16 - Philippe Charpentier
 - For Links associator, allow not to build a table (declared as "") to get 
   relations on the flight (reimplementation of the IAsct interface)
 - Implies removing Particle2MCWeightedAsct.h and creating Particle2MCLinksAsct.h
   and a .cpp as well

   - move declaration outside for()
   - add CompositeParticlesLinks to DaVinciAssociators_load
 - Adapt to coding convention indentations in CompositeParticlesLinks
 - Modify CompositeParticlesLinks options to adapt to changes
 - Introduce CompositeParticlesLinks in DaVinciAssociators.opts

! 2002-10-09 - Gloria Corti
 - Modify CompositeParticle2MCLinks to have Particle2MCLinks as weighted
   given modifications in Particle2MCLinks, introduce shortcut name of
   used associator

! 2002-09-30 - Philippe Charpentier
 - Add CompositeParticle2MCLinks associator (G.Raven)
 - Add NeutralPP2MC associator (I.Belyaev)
 - Change name for ProtoParticle2MC associator to ChargedPP2MC (as there is
   now a NeutralPP2MC
 - Create options files for each concrete associator (i.e. one per algorithm)
 - Use dedicated associators "WithChi2" for "Chi2" Asct and of
   "ChargedPP2MC" for "Particle2MCLinks"
 - Include TestAssociators algorithm (from DaVinciTest package)

! 2002-09-12 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce Neutral ProtoParticle Associator from I.Belyaev

! 2002-09-09 - Gloria Corti
 - Introdude additional location in ProtoParticle2MCLinks for Upstream
   charged ProtoP (D.Hutchcroft)
 - Use PhysEvent v7r0 and increase version number to v3r0 in requirements

! 2002-09-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - in Particle2MCLinks, register the produced table only once in the TES 
   when specifying more than one 'source' of particles to be associated

!================= DaVinciAssociators v2r0 2002-07-29 ======================
! 2002-07-27 - Gloria Corti
 - add some std:: adn move template in body of class to compile on window
 - move template implementation in body of AsctAlgorithm to compile on 
   window

! 2002-07-18 - Gloria Corti
 - Use PhysEvent v6r* and remove use of EventSys

! 2002-07-17 - Philippe Charpentier
 - Transform Particle2MCLinks in order to use the ProtoParticle2MC associator
 - Base class AsctAlgorithm in order to implement standard Properties and a
    templated method for setting up a Private auxiliary associator
    retrievePrivateAsct(...) which defines privat tool, alg and Location.
    This avoid interference with default or user defined associators of same
    type

! 2002-07-15 - Philippe Charpentier
 - Property "InputData" of associators now a vector of strings, allowing
    more than one input location
 - Property "OutputData" changed to "OutputTable"
 - New associator for OO-DST: ProtoParticle2MCAsct for associations between 
    ProtoParticles and MCParticles. Implemented for charged tracks only
 - Associator from ZEBRA links still present for backward compatibility, will
    eventually be removed
 - Chi2 algorithm uses now its own instance of a "WithChi2" associator, as an
    example on how to do this and set correctly the properties. This allows
    the use of multiple instances of the Chi2 associator if needed...

!================= DaVinciAssociators v1r0p1 2002-06-07 ====================
! 2002-06-07 - Marco Cattaneo

!================= DaVinciAssociators v1r0 2002-06-05 ======================
! 20020517 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Changed the name of the associators following discussions
     Particle2MCAsct : 2 algorithms Particle2MCChi2 and Particle2MCLinks
   - New Associator
     Particle2MCWithChi2Asct : filled with Particle2MCWithChi2
     This is a "weighted" associator which uses the best chi2 as weight
     Particle2MCChi2 uses this associator as input and simply makes a cut

!==============================================================================
! 20020510 - Philippe Charpentier
   - Example on how to use two different algorithms with the same
      associator (with Chi2 or with links to AxPartCandidates)
   - Changed naming of algorithms to be shorter:
      Part2MCChi2 (default)
      Part2MCLink
   - Part2MCLink not tested until DaVinci v4r0 is available in CVS
