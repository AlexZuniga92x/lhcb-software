/** @class DaVinciSmartAssociator DaVinciSmartAssociator.h
 *
 *  A ``smart'' associator for any kind of particle. Returns a vector of
 *  MCAssociation objects, each of which represents a single associated MCParticle
 *  and its association weight. The association methods used are
 *
 *  Charged stables: Protoparticle associator
 *  Neutral stables: Neutral Protoparticle associator
 *  Composite: BackgroundCategory
 *
 *  For composites, there is always at most one associated MCParticle, whose
 *  association weight is set to 1 by definition
 *
 *  Implements IParticle2MCAssociator, but does not satisfy its rules, since the
 *  retrieval of associations of stable particles interacts with the linker
 *  mechanism on the TES, which can populate the TES with linker objects
 *  when these don't already exist, and thus has direct side-effects. It also has the
 *  added constraint that the LHCb::MCParticles to be associated
 *  HAVE to be on the TES always, and the LHCb::Particles have to be on the TES if they are
 *  stable. However, the results returned to the user are self-contained and independent
 *  of the TES.
