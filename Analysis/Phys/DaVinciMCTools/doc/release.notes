! Package     : DaVinciMCTools
! Responsible : Gloria Corti

! 2002-09-18 - Olivier Dormond
 - Small fix to the DebugTool printout.

! 2002-09-09 - Gloria Corti
 - Set default values of Chi2/NoF in MCPIDProtoPAlg as from Helder results 
 - Set MuonMuon PID detector value when isMuon() as from Roger studies
 - Remove obsolete keepTrack method (replaced by rejectTrack)
 - Use new versions of PhysEvent and DaVinci Associators and increase 
   version number

! 2002-09-03 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce cut on Chi2 per degree of Freedom in MCPIDProtoPAlg,
	 also introduce error counters with printing in finalize and possibility 
	 of monitoring ntuple	 

!========================== DaVinciMCTools v2r0 2002-07-29 =================
! 2002-07-26 - Gloria Corti
 - Bug fix for muonpid filling in MCPIDProtoPAlg
 - add detectorID information for electrons when making ProtoParticles 
   in MCPIDProtoPAlg, this implies introducing options files
 - put as options to use upstream tracks or not in making ProtoParticles
   (by default not taken) in MCPIDProtoPAlg

| 2002-07-26 - Olivier Dormond
 - Added alternative decay at top level, i.e. you can write 
   "{B0 -> K+ pi-, B0 -> K- pi+}".
 - Added alternative set of decay products, i.e. you can write
   "B0 -> {K+ pi-, K- pi+}".
 - Added a test for the oscilation flag _not_ being set as "[..]nos".

! 2002-07-25 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce std namespace in reclexer.lpp and icpp to allow compilation
   on Window, comment use of <unistd.h> not existing on windows and not
   necessary.
 - Make enum public and move template implementation in body of class
   in DecayFinder. 

! 2002-07-18 - Gloria Corti
 - Use PhysEvent v6r*
 - New algorithm MCPIDProtoPAlg and related options file to make charged
   ProtoParticles and use the MC truth particle ID of the associated 
   track to set its combined ParticleID. If associated tracks does not exist
   the particle is assumed to be a pion. The detector PID information is
   added when available for the track (taht of electron not added yet)

! 2002-07-10 - Olivier Dormond
 - Duplication of the interfaces' methods to support keyed container.
 - Quark wildcard support. It's now possible to ask for any particle with
   a b~ quark and so on. The syntax is simply "<Xq>" where q can be
   replaced by up to 3 quarks. Quarks are u,d,c,s,t,b,u~,d~,c~,s~,t~,b~.

! 2002-06-27 - Gloria Corti
 - comment use of <unistd.h> in generated mclexer.icpp because it is not
   available on win and it is not necessary

! 2002-06-23 - Olivier Dormond
 - cosmetic changes in DebugTool
 - use std::strings in MCDecayFinder parsing

! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> DaVinciMCTools v1r0 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

! 2002-05-24 - Gloria Corti
 - Use commited version of yacc automatically generated code (win)
 - Remove YYCLASS in mcparser.ypp to fix compilation error on win
 - Replace strndup in mclexer.lpp (not available on win) with 
   strncpy (Pere Mato)

! 2002-05-19 Gloria Corti
  Package holding tools for analysis of Monte Carlo events
  - DebugTools (Olivier Dormond): tools to printout tree in MC event and
    Phys Event
  - MCDecayFinder (Olivier Dormond): retrieve decay following a
    "string description" in jobOptions (see explanations in header file)
    Use a special parser yacc (fragments and
    changes in requirements, and recparser.ypp, reclexer.lpp)
