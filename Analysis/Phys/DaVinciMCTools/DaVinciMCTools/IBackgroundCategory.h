/** @class IBackgroundCategory IBackgroundCategory.h pkoppenb/IBackgroundCategory.h
 *
 *  Returns the background category for a reconstructed candidate Particle  
 *
 *Conditions:
 *
 *  -  <b>A:</b> all final-state particles used to form the candidate are matched to 
 *        decay products of the same true MC particle (not necessarily the signal) 
 *
 *  -  <b>B:</b> all final-state MC particles originating from the true MC particle 
 *   defined in A are matched to particles used to form the candidate
 *   (except photons generated by PHOTOS);
 *   in case the decay descriptor of the true MC particle
 *   defined in A corresponds to an inclusive decay, "all final-state MC
 *   particles" only include the particles required in this (semi-)inclusivei
 *   decay. 
 *
 *  -  <b>C:</b> all final-state particles used to form the candidate are correctly 
 *  identified, i.e. have been assigned their correct (true) mass
 *  
 *  -  <b>D:</b> the true MC particle defined in A is a signal decay according 
 *   to the decay descriptor, or the head of a decay chain which differs 
 *  from the signal decay chain only by the presence or absence of 
 *  intermediate resonances but has other otherwise the same head,
 * same final state particles and same topology.
 *
 *  -  <b>E:</b> the true MC particle defined in A is a signal decay according 
 *  to the decay descriptor, and all intermediate states of this 
 * decay are correctly reconstructed (as listed in the decay descriptor)
 *
 *  -  <b>F:</b> the true MC particle defined in A has a mass which does not exceed
 *  the mass of the head of the decay descriptor by more than 100 MeV/c2
 *  (tunable parameter)
 *
 *  -  <b>G:</b> at least one final-state particle used to form the candidate is a ghost
 *  
 *  -  <b>H:</b> final-state particles used to form the candidate are matched to 
 *  true particles from at least two different collisions (pileup)
 *  
 *  -  <b>I:</b> at least one final-state particles used to form the candidate is 
 *  matched to a true decay product of a b-hadron 
 *  (following mother-daughter relationships all the way through)
 *   
 *  -  <b>J:</b> at least one final-state particles used to form the candidate is 
 *  matched to a true decay product of a c-hadron
 *  (following mother-daughter relationships all the way through)
 *  
 *

 *<b>Examples:</b>
 *
 *a) A reconstructed Bs -> (Ds -> KKpi) pi decay could be categorized 
 *  as signal with respect to the decay descriptor 
 *  {[[B_s0]nos -> (D_s- => K+ K- pi-) pi+]cc, 
 *   [[B_s0]os  -> (D_s+ => K- K+ pi+) pi-]cc}
 *  even if the MC truth indicates a Bs -> (Ds -> (phi -> KK) pi) pi decay.
 *  
 *b) A reconstructed Bd -> K* mumu should not be categorized as a signal
 *  with respect to the decay descriptor 
 *  {[[B0]nos -> (J/psi(1S) -> mu+ mu- {,gamma} {,gamma}) 
 *               (K*(892)0 -> K+ pi-)]cc, 
 *   [[B0]os  -> (J/psi(1S) -> mu+ mu- {,gamma} {,gamma})
 *               (K*(892)~0 -> K- pi+)]cc} 
 *  no matter what the MC truth indicates.   
 *   
 *c) A reconstructed Bd -> K* mumu should not be categorized as a signal 
 *  with respect to the decay descriptor 
 *  {[[B0]nos -> mu+ mu- (K*(892)0 -> K+ pi-)]cc, 
 *   [[B0]os -> mu- mu+ (K*(892)~0 -> K- pi+)]cc} 
 *  if the MC truth indicates a Bd -> K* J/psi(mumu) decay.
 *
 *d) A reconstructed Bs -> mu+mu- candidate matched to a true 
 *  J/psi -> mu+mu- decay (could happen if the sidebands around the Bs 
 *  are very large) and a reconstructed Bd -> K+K- matched to a true 
 *  Bs -> K+K- are both classified as fully-reconstructed physics 
 *  background.
 *  
 *e) A reconstructed Bs -> (Ds -> KKpi) pi candidate matched to a 
 *  a true Bd -> (D- -> Kpipi) pi decay (mis-ID of one of the pions 
 *  from the D- as a kaon) is classified as a reflection.
 *  
 *f) A reconstructed B- -> (D0 -> K-pi+) pi- candidate matched to 
 *  to the K-,pi+ and pi- of a true Lambda_b -> (Lambda_c -> p K-pi+) pi-
 *  is classified as a partially-reconstructed physics background.
 *  
 *g) A reconstructed Bs -> (Ds -> KKpi) pi+ candidate with all 4 tracks
 *  matched to the true final state particles of a true 
 *  Bs -> (Bs ->KKpi) pi+pi0 decay is classified as a low-mass background.
