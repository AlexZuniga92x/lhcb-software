! Package     : Phys/FlavourTagging
! Responsible : Olivier Dormond
! Purpose     : Provide tools and algorithm for tagging Bs
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2003-04-10 - Olivier Dormond
 - Added a combined particle maker until one is available globally.
 - The FlavourTaggingAlgorithm now reports the statistical errors at the end
   of the job.
 - Added a tool to implement the same-side kaon tagging.
 - Added a simple algorithm to summarise all the generated tags for a B in
   one line.
 - Cleanup the options files.

!==================== FlavourTagging v4r2 2003-01-06 =====================
! 2003-01-06 - Florence Ranjard
 - requirements - use LHCb v11r5

! =================== FlavourTagging v4r1 2003-01-06 ======================
! 2002-12-20 - Gloria Corti
 - Remove explicit dependecy of EventKernel in requirements

! 2002-11-20 - Olivier Dormond
 - Restructured the option files (have a look in 
   /afs/cern.ch/user/o/odie/public/DaVinciOptionsForTheTagging for a set of
   option files for DaVinci).
 - Added support for multiple-collision in the FlavourMonitorAlgorithm. Stats
   are now splitted by number of collisions.
 - Added check for the L0 trigger in FlavourTaggingAlgorithm.
 - Droped the ntuple from the SingleParticleTaggingTool.
 - Added a SingleParticleTaggingMonitor to study the job of the so-named tool.

! =================== FlavourTagging v4r0 2002-11-13 ======================
! 2002-11-13 - Gloria Corti
 - Use explicitely EventKernel v2r0 because of compilation error
 - Use new major versions of DaVinciTools (v7r*) and DaVinciMCTools (v4r*)

! =================== FlavourTagging v3r0 2002-10-30 ======================
! 2002-10-21 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce some missing std:: to compile on windows

! 2002-10-19 - Olivier Dormond
 - Fixed a typo which caused the error on the effective efficiency to be wrong.
 - Added three options files to do tagging with only one kind a particle (Kaon,
   muon, electron).

! 2002-09-20 - Olivier Dormond
 - requirement: added DaVinciMCTools v3r* for the monitoring.
 - FlavourTagging.opts: Changed particle maker to Charged and "All".
 -                      Changed measured Z cut to more closely match the VELO.
 -                      Added setting for the FlavourTaggingDebug algorithm.
 - FlavourTaggingAlgorithm: Added a property 'FirstOnly' (default to false)
     which will let the tagging only use the first B in each hypo location.
     The idea is to have a workaround for the strange behaviour of the
     SelectBs2mumu algo which produces n^2 identical Bs where n is the number
     of primary vertices.
 - SingleParticleTaggingTool: Fixed the removing of the B decay products from
     the event by comparing the ProtoParticles. It could be replaced by the
     CheckOverlap tool when commonly available.
 - Added a FlavourTaggingDebug algorithm which dumps the B and the event.

! 2002-09-13 - Gloria Corti
 - Remove use of PhysEvent, update version of use used packages to be
   consistent with DaVinci v6r0 and set version to v3r0

! =================== FlavourTagging v2r0 2002-09-10 ======================
! 2002-09-10 - Olivier Dormond
 - Monitor: Divided the statistics based on how well the B has been 
            reconstructed.
 - Tagging: Added a consistency check.
 - SPTT:    Added the event and run number to the ntuple.
 - All:     Small code layout changes.

! 2002-09-06 - Olivier Dormond
 - Made a cleanup of the abort messages.
 - Fixed the handling of the vertices so the impact param cut realy works.

! 2002-09-05 - Olivier Dormond
 - Fixed computation and report of the statistics for tagging and monitoring
 - Added the missing writeRecord so the ntuples are realy filled in!
 - Stripped down the generated name for the ntuple by only using the last
   part of the tool name (the one after the rightmost dot).

! 2002-09-03 - Olivier Dormond
 - The "/Particles" part of the hypothesis locations is now added
   automatically if not present.
 - Added a check to avoid trying to tag particles without a bottom quark.

! 2002-09-03 - Olivier Dormond
 - Swapped the way particles and B hypothesis are setup. Now the PhysDesktop
   takes care of the particles and the B are handled seperatly.
 - Support multiple locations for the B.
 - The tools support both Particles and ParticleVector.
 - The tools can produce an ntuple for optimization.
 - The tools can save a FlavourTag for the monitoring only.
 - Added a FlavourMonitorAlgorithm to check the FlavourTag against the truth.

! 2002-07-18 - Gloria Corti
 - Increase version number to v2r0 and use DaVinciTools v5r*
