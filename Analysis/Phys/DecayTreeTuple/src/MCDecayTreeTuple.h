 *
 * \brief This is the new version of the so-called DecayChainNTuple
 *
 * \section basics (Basic usage:)
 * 
 * MCDecayTreeTuple has a decay descriptor (given by the Decay
 * property). One line of the Tuple if filled for each reconstructed
 * candidate. This algorithm is NOT backward compatible with
 * DecayChainNTuple. Yet the base syntax is quite close.
 *
 * Here is a minimalist but working example:
 * \verbatim
 from Configurables import MCDecayTreeTuple, GaudiSequencer
 MyMCDecayTreeTuple = MCDecayTreeTuple("MyMCDecayTreeTuple")
 GaudiSequencer("MySeq").Members =+ [ MyMCDecayTreeTuple]
 MyMCDecayTreeTuple.Decay = "B0 -> ^pi- ^pi+"
 MyMCDecayTreeTuple.TupleName = "MyTuple"\endverbatim
 *
 * \note Any particle to be stored in the Tuple has to be flagged with
 * '^' (an exception here is the decay head which cannot be flagged as
 * DecayFinder will refuse it. Top level particle are therefore always
 * stored).
