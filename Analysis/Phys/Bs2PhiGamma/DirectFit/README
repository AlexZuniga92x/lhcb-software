In this package you should have all the useful macros to run the direct fit. Several steps have to be done in order to perform the fit:

define an environment variable as

setenv ROOLIB (path to)/macros

cd $ROOLIB

root -l

.x libCompil.C

then you go to where the codes timeFitData.C and timeFitMC.C are and do

root -l 

.x $ROOLIB/libLoader.C

.L timeFitData.C+ (or timeFitMC.C+)

then do

timeFitData(options that are explained inside the macro)


If you find any dificulty running them please let me know

I put the data files for jpsikst kstg and phig with the direct fit selection and I also put the weight file for jpsikst.

If you find some missing file two cases are possible, either this file is not important and you can comment the line where it is called or it is importatn and then you would have to contact me so that I can provide it.

have fun
