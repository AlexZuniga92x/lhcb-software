! 2010-09-03 - Rob Lambert
 - Updated StrippingB0q2DplusMuX.py
 - New line added 'StrippingB0q2DplusMuXTuned'
   --------------------------------------------------
   Rate: ~0.001%, Av CPU: 0.977 ms, Max CPU: 75.4 ms.
   --------------------------------------------------
   . It has been known for a while that StrippingB0q2DplusMuXPresel is too
     loose for the latest data, in terms of both Rate and timing, hence
     it is by default prescaled by a factor 10.
   . as discussed in the Semileptonic Taskforce I added an intermediate line.
     This new line: StrippingB0q2DplusMuXTuned uses the same variables
     as the two existing lines Presel, MC09, but is tighter than Presel,
     Looser than MC09, particularly looser in the PID requirements.
   . The timing and rate of this line are much better than the Presel line


! 2010-09-02 - Anton Poluektov 
 - Updated StrippingB2DX.py. Performance with 20k Reco05-Stripping08 data:

! 2010-09-01 - Greig Cowan
 - Added StrippingB2JpsiXforBeta_s.py. This contains all (well, it will eventually)
   JpsiX lines associated to the beta_s group. This uses the new "selection
   configurables" framework. There is a new inclusive Jpsi line which writes out
   the StdMassConstrainedJpsi2MuMu particles. All of the inclusive lines are 
   subsets of this line. Rates are 0.2% on my test data sample for the inclusive line
   and <0.06% for the exclusive lines. All lines take <1ms/event on average. 

! 2010-09-01 - Rolf Oldeman
 - added StrippingB2twobody.py

! 2010-09-01 - Johannes Albrecht
 - adapt detached JPsi selection in StrippingBs2MuMuLines.py

! 2010-08-30 - Liming Zhang
 - Modify StrippingBs2Jpsif0.py and StrippingBs2PhiMuMu.py: tighten cuts
   and remove loose line in Bs->Jpsif0

! 2010-08-28 - Yasmine Amhis 
  - Modify Lambdab2JpsiLambda lines 
  . release Lambda mass cut. 
! 2010-08-26 - Rob Lambert

   by the taskforce.

! 2010-08-26 - Nicola Mangiafave
 - Tightened Bu2KJpsiPiPiLooseLine to reach 0.1% retention.

! 2010-08-25
 - Harder cuts in StrippingD2hh.py D2hhPIDLine.

! 2010-08-25 - Anton Poluektov 
 - Tightened StrippingB2DX selections: introduced DIRA, DOCA for D candidates, 
   minimum PV separation for at least one of daughters for D->hh, D->hhh, 
   cut on the number of tracks in the event. 
   Default set of cuts gives 1.6% total retention for all B2DX lines. 

! 2010-08-25 - Greig Cowan
 - Set prescale of StrippingDstarVeryLooseWithD02HH to 0.01 as it was taking too much rate.
   Should now be ~0.06% retention.

! 2010-08-24 - Yasmine Amhis
 - Tightened  track cuts for StrippingLambdab2JpsiLambda lines.
    	 
! 2010-08-24 - Vanya Belyaev

  -Change the cuts in Lambdab2JpsiLambdaLL/DD lines 

!========================== StrippingSelections v1r26 2010-08-20 ==============

! 2010-08-20 - Patrick Spradlin
  - Removed from StreamCharm.py the untagged D0 lines defined in
    StrippingDstarPromptWithD02HH.py (StripDstarPromptD02xxAloneLine lines).
    The tagged lines are still included.

! 2010-08-18 - Hamish Gordon
  - Commented out remaining D->3h cross section lines in StreamCharm
  - Removed vertex chi2 cut from these cross section lines

! 2010-08-15 - Anton Poluektov 
 - Modified StrippingB2DX: 
    * Changes in the code structure
    * Added LambdaB->LambdaC pi/K by Rudolf Oldeman
    * Modified D->KPiPi0 and D->hhhh selections (use cuts by Aurelien Martens)
    * Removed Ds mass window for neutral D combinations
    * Prescaling instead of postscaling
    * Get rid of 'signal' lines: instead, can duplicate lines with tighter cuts. 
      Should be faster than filtering and postscaling. 

! 2010-08-13 - Marco Gersabeck 
 - Included StrippingD2hh to StreamCharm and removed StrippingD2hhNoPID, StrippingD2Kh, StrippingD2KhLoose

! 2010-08-13 - Steve Blusk

      D0->K3pi line
 - StrippingDForBSemi.py: new lines added to reconstruct D+, Ds 
      and /\c for B0->DMuNuX study. Prescaled by 1/10. CPU time 
      0.2-0.3 ms/event for each line, retention rate 0.05%-0.3% 
 - for details see http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=5&sessionId=1&resId=1&materialId=slides&confId=103204

! 2010-13-10 - Francesco Dettori 
  - Modified StrippingDstarD02xx.py to require correspondent HLT2 for each line
  - Tightened cuts for StrippingLambdac.py

! 2010-08-13 - Marco Gersabeck 
 - Added StrippingD2hh to replace existing D0->hh lines, changed StrippingD2hhNoPIDXsec (relaxed cuts, added prescale)

! 2010-08-13 - Anton Poluektov 
 - Added StrippingReport to TestMyStrippingLineOnRealData.py
   Shows accept rate, time/event for benchmarking. 

! 2010-08-13 - Neal Gauvin
 - The DisplVertices lines don't depend anymore on BestPIDParticleMaker. Gain in CPU time by a factor 2.
   Physics remains unchanged.

! 2010-08-11 - Vanya Belyaev

 - add StrippingTriMuons.py 
      and include it into StreamDimuon.py

! 2010-08-10 - Greig Cowan
 - Added new Reco05-Stripping08 data sample and restructured tests directory.
   The sample comes from run 77222 which is from fill 1266 with TCK 0x0019001F
   (Hlt in rejection mode). The mu for this fill was 1.1 -> 0.98.
 - Reco04-Stripping07 data has new POOL XML catalog.
 - Tightened up cuts for Bd2DstarMuNuLoose line. Retention on Reco05-Stripping08 is 0.3%.
   Timing is ~7ms/event but this involves building D0 and Dstar CommonParticles which are used
   elsewhere. I have added the line back into the semileptonic stream definition.

! 2010-08-09 - Steve Blusk

 - Modified StrippingB2D3H: make D mesons with StdLooseKaons, and add some prescale/postscales if needed.
 - If prescales needed, there is an ordered list of preferred ways to do this in StrippingB2D3HConf()
   
! 2010-08-08 - Vanya Belyaev

 - small fix in SrippingPromptCharm
   

! 2010-08-07 - Vanya Belyaev

 - PromptCharm

    make use of new CheckPV syntax by Anton 

! 2010-08-05 - Nicola Mangiafave
 - Added to StreamDimuon 3 new lines:
 - Bu2KJpsiPiPiLooseLine = loose line for B+ -> K+ X(3872)(->J/psi(mumu)rho(pipi)) 
   and  B+ -> K+ Psi(2S)(->J/psi(mumu)pi+pi-). 
 - Bu2KX3872Line = tight line for B+ -> K+ X(3872)(->J/psi(mumu)rho(pi+pi-)). 
 - Bu2KPsi2SLine = tight line for B+ -> K+ Psi(2S)(->J/psi(mumu)pi+pi-). 

! 2010-08-05 - Alexandr Kozlinskiy
 - updated DstarPromptWithD02HHNoPt: added PID cuts on kaon and pion from D0.

! 2010-08-03 - Vanya Belyaev

 - StrippingPromptCharm.py

! 2010-07-29 -Yasmine Amhis 
    -Change a cut (LambdabVCHI2) in StrippingLambdab2JpsiLambda

! 2010-07-29 - Philip Hunt
  - Added new stripping lines for D0 -> K3Pi and D*+ -> (D0 -> K3Pi) pi+ for
    the cross-section measurement (StrippingD02K3Pi.py).
    These are based on the "Selection" framework requirement, and will replace
    the previous lines found in StrippingD02K3PiForXSection.py.
    The lines now take about ~2ns per event on average on the previous test
    data, and ~17ns per event on average for the Reco04-Stripping07 high pileup
    data
  - The physics line for D*+ -> (D0 -> K3Pi) pi+ , found in
    StrippingDstarPromptWithD02K3Pi.py will be left disabled until these lines 
    have been optimised for the current run conditions

! 2010-07-29 -Yasmine Amhis
  - Update  StrippingLambdab2JpsiLambda.py
    . Version  added on the same day was  WRONG ! 

! 2010-07-29 - Greig Cowan 
  - Added list of Reco04-Stripping07 LFNs to tests directory. Updated the test
    script to use them. This data is more representative of current running
    conditions and corresponds to:
	
	RunID	FillID	TCK		
	75414	1224	0x0013001F

  - Modified StrippingBd2JpsiKstar.py tight and loose lines so that Jpsi comes
    first in the sequence, before the Kstar is filtered. This speeds up the line.
  - As above but for Bs2JpsiPhi.

! 2010-07-29 - Yasmie Amhis 
  - Add  new stripping lines for Lambda_b -> Jpsi Lambda 
   StrippingLambdab2JpsiLambda (LL and DD lines)
  - Added to StreamDimuon

! 2010-01-15 - Vanya Belyaev

 - StrippingV0.py, StrippingV0Geo.py

   The "main" configurable  resides in StrippingV0 and has the name 
   StrippingV0Conf (and it includes "Geo"-lines!)
 

Following V0-lines are implemented:

   1. "Conventional" K0S 
   2. "Conventional" Lambda0
   3. "Geometry"     K0S 
   4. "Geometry"     Lambda0

The lines 1&2 are subdivided into 4 lines each:    

     a.  PV  
     b.  PV    & wrong-sign
     c.  no-PV  
     d.  no-PV & wrong-sign

In total we have 10 stripping lines.

For 3&4 I've used the preliminary version of Mathias' code.
As soon as I'll get the updated version, I'll insert it into 
V0-configurable.


The table below contains the results of two tests

  Test1: The full stripping test with 100k 2009-events (without re-recontruction of PV), including empty&lumi events  

  Test2: The test with 10k events from with Juan' datset (at least one re-recontructed "loose" PV)

Global decision |  StrippingGlobal                | 4150   |
===================================================================

No "PV-redo" has been used for this data.

Let me remind the cuts for "Conventional" selection:

    - Track selection:  P > 1.5 GeV , chi2(Track)/nDof < 10 
    
    - V0 selection : 

        -- |M-M0|  < 100 * MeV
        -- chi2_VX <  25  
        -- chi2_LT < 100 
        -- c*tau > 10 mm for DD case else  c*tau > 1 mm 

    For "no-PV" case, there are no cuts on chi2_LT and c*tau 


Note that the numebrs for Mathias' selction are very preliminary and 
probably will be different as soon as preselection will be ready

 - Changed Bd2K*MuMu selection to use FilterDesktop instances, 
     not StrippingMembers.

! 2009-07-09 - V.Gligorov
 - Updated the StrippingTopo selection. The major changes are the addition of the
   "robust" stage and the prescaling of the 4-body topological line (10%).

! 2009-07-09 - V.Gligorov
 - Updated the StrippingB2DPi selection. The major changes are documented
   at the start of the file itself. Note that despite its name this selection
   selects B->DX with D=D0,D+,Ds and X=pi,K,K*,phi. More details on what is and
   is not selected are given in the options file itself.
