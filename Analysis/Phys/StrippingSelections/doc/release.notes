! Package     : Phys/StrippingSelections
! Responsible : Anton Poluektov
! Purpose     : Stripping selections
! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2009-07-10 - Rob Lambert
 - Changed Bd2K*MuMu selection to use FilterDesktop instances, 
     not StrippingMembers.

! 2009-07-09 - V.Gligorov
 - Updated the StrippingTopo selection. The major changes are the addition of the
   "robust" stage and the prescaling of the 4-body topological line (10%).

! 2009-07-09 - V.Gligorov
 - Updated the StrippingB2DPi selection. The major changes are documented
   at the start of the file itself. Note that despite its name this selection
   selects B->DX with D=D0,D+,Ds and X=pi,K,K*,phi. More details on what is and
   is not selected are given in the options file itself. 

! 2009-07-09 - Rob Lambert
 - InputLocation fix in MuMuK* selection

! 2009-07-09 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Typo fix in MuMuK8 selection

! 2009-07-07 - Anton Poluektov
 - Modified tests/StrippingSTEP09.py to demonstrate the new StreamFile option
   in StrippingConf

! 2009-07-07 - Rob Lambert
 - Updated the StrippingBd2KstarMuMu
    - Added the 1Hz, "NoChi2" selection
    - Updated inputlocations to new CommonParticles
    - Simplified structure with new CombineParticles
 - There are now three lines:
		- Strip_Bd2KstarMuMu_10Hz
    - Strip_Bd2KstarMuMu_2Hz
    - Strip_Bd2KstarMuMu_1Hz

!===================== StrippingSelections v1r1 2009-07-02 ====================

! 2009-06-29 - Greig Cowan
 - Updated the InputLocations for Bd2JpsiKstar.

! 2009-June-25 - Patrick Spradlin and Andrew Powell
 - Added a stripping selection for D*+ -> D0(K pi) pi without PID information
   for RICH calibration.

! 2009-06-24 - Greig Cowan
 - Added an exclusive "presclaed and detached" selection for Bs->JpsiPhi.
 - Updated Bs2JpsiPhi and Bd2JpsiKstar strippings to use the new Phi and Kstar
   CommonParticles as have recently been defined. 

!===================== StrippingSelections v1r0p1 2009-06-23 ====================
! 2009-06-23 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Fix DC06 options

!===================== StrippingSelections v1r0 2009-06-03 ====================

! 2009-06-02 - Anton Poluektov
 - Added selections and test job for STEP09.

! 2009-05-31 - V. Gligorov
 - Fixed stupid bug introduced when removing the K* mass cuts. 

! 2009-05-29 - V. Gligorov
 - Added a stripping line for the topological trigger.

! 2009-05-29 - V. Gligorov
 - Removed the K* mass cuts in the B2DPi stripping file for the B->DKpi Dalitz
   analysis.

! 2009-05-24 - V. Gligorov
 - Updated the B2DPi stripping file to select all B2DX combinations where
   X = {K*,phi,pi,K}. Eventually the file will be renamed but first it needs
   to be rewritten in terms of StrippingMembers and otherwise cleaned up.

! 2009-05-29 - Greig Cowan
 - Updated beta_s channel strippings to use BPVIPCHI2 rather than 
   MIPCHI2DV(PRIMARY) so that PV refitting is done.

! 2009-05-22 - Anton Poluektov
 - Included Greig's selections into StrippingSelections.py
 - Made a DaVinci test file (TestGreig.py) to test Bs2JpsiPhi selection.

! 2009-05-21 - Greig Cowan
 - Updated the beta_s channels to use the new StdLTUnbiasedJpsi CommonParticles.

! 2009-05-21 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Bd2KstarMuMu_10Hz line : added the 'd'

! 2009-05-20 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Moved to here legacy DC06 stripping options
 - Moved python options to options
 - Added options/Stripping.py file that can be included trivially from any main file.

  Initial release. Content of this package: 
    * tests/StrippingDummy.py --- Dummy stripping selection, 
                                  example of StrippingMember features
                            
    * tests/TestStrippingDummy.py  --- DaVinci test job
    
    * python/Stripping*.py   --- here the actial selections should go
    * tests/TestStripping.py --- run all stripping selections from python/
