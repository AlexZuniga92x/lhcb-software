 - Moved relevant QMTests from AnalysisSys.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v4r2
  . Add QMTests

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v4r1 2010-02-22 ================

! 2010-02-19 - Juan Palacios
 - python/PhysSelPython/selection.py
  . Loosen the requirements in Selection input algorithms. Allow algorithms 
    with InputLocations compatible with those set by RequiredSelections.
 - tests/seleciton.py
  . Add tests for the above (chronoligically this step comes first!)

! 2010-02-17 - Juan Palacios
 - python/PhysSelPython/selection.py
  . DataOnDemand no longer needs name argument. In its absence, name is 
    trailing part of Location.
  . Selection raises NonEmptyInputLocations if InputLocations of input 
    Algorithm are not empty.
 - tests/seleciton.py
  . Add tests for the above (chronoligically this step comes first!)
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v4r1

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v4r0 2010-02-02 ================

! 2010-02-03 - Juan Palacios
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v4r0

! 2010-02-02 - Juan Palacios
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py, selection.py
  . Move sequence() method from SelSequence to wrapper class SelectionSequence.
    selection.py now totally independent of configurables.
 - tests/test_selection_sequence.py
  . Adapt to changes in interface.

! 2010-01-27 - Juan Palacios
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Selection, SelectionSequence raise PhysSelPython.Wrappers.NameError if
    attempt is made to create or clone one with the name of a previously
    existing one.
 - tests
  . Switch off tests to do with algorithms raising if attempt is made to 
    instantiate them or clone them with the name of an existing algorithm. 
    This isn't done in Gaudi, and we are trying to replicate that (awful) 
    behaviour.
  . Add tests for Selection and SelectionSequence raising if attempt is made to
    create or clone them with name of existing one.

! 2010-01-26 - Juan PALACIOS
 - Added tests directory with some py.test test functions.
 - added __init__.py to allow to use and test PhysSelPython.Wrappers
   without InstallArea of any special environment.
 - Added python/PhysSelPython/Configurabloids.py with some dummy configurables
   for testing.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v3r3

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v3r2p1 2010-01-22 ==============

! 2010-01-22 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Protect Selection against input Algorithm with non-empty InputSelections: remove
    input InputSelections from local clone. All InputSelections are set from the 
    RequiredSelections.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v3r2p1

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v3r2 2009-11-30 ================

! 2009-11-26 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Add clone method to SelectionSequence
  . Add clone method to Selection
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v3r2

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v3r1 2009-10-28 ================

! 2009-10-28 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Remove unnecessary imports.
  . Add AutomaticData alias for DataOnDemand, and improve documentation.

! 2009-10-27 - Juan PALACIOS
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v3r1.

! 2009-10-21 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . SelectionSequence: Add PostSelectionAlgs list to add algorithms to be run
    after selection. Empty by default.

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v3r0p1 2009-10-19 ==============

! 2009-10-19 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . SelectionSequence important bug fix. Sequence was getting corrupted when
    more than one SelectionSequence created in same scope is created with an
    empty EventPreSelector list.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v3r0p1

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v3r0 2009-10-15 ================

! 2009-10-13 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Add name() for backwards compatibility.
  . SelectionSequence: make GaudiSequencer "on-demand" from local list of
    algorithms to avoid problems with Members not being understood. Triggered
    by calling the sequence() method.
  . SelectionSequence: Add EventPreSelector, list of event selecting 
    algorithms to be added at the beginning of the sequence.

! 2009-10-12 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Add algorithm() method for backward compatibility.

! 2009-10-12 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Wrappers are now simple classes, not LHCbConfigurableUsers.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v3r0

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v2r2p1 2009-10-12 ================

! 2009-10-02 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Selection class gets InputLocations from RequiredSelection's outputLocation(), NOT algName().
    These are now different and previous behaviour was buggy in case of explicit locations.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v2r2p1

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v2r2 2009-10-02 ==================

! 2009-10-02 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . DataOnDemand: get algName() from outputLocation()
  . DataOnDemand docs: input location, not algo name.
  . Selection: Improve docs

! 2009-09-28 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Selection: Add property "OutputBranch", controlling branch to which data
    are outputted. E.g. "Phys", "Hlt".

! 2009-08-25 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . SelectionSequence applies configuration of all member Selections.
  . Add algos field with straight list of algorithms.
 - cmt/requirements
  . v2r2
!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v2r1 2009-08-27 ==================

! 2009-08-25 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . add outputLocations() method to SelectionSequence. For compatibility with
    StrippingStream class. Returns single-entry list with "Phys/"+ algName()
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v2r1

! 2009-08-21 - Juan PALACIOS
 - cmt/requirements
  . Use GaudiConf and LHCbKernel explicitly

! 2009-08-18 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Class SelectionSequence: avoid reversing sequence. Insert algorithms in 0th
    position. Insert main algo in 0th position in case the sequence has been
    already built elsewhere.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v2r0p1

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v2r0 2009-08-11 ==================

! 2009-08-09 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
  . Complete overhaul. Selection and SelectionSequence are now configurables.
  . New wrapper for data-on-demand location. Mimicks a Selection.
 - cmt/requirements
  . Increase version to v2r0

!==================== PhysSel/PhysSelPython v1r0 2009-07-15 ==================

! 2009-07-14 - Juan PALACIOS
 - python/PhysSelPython/Wrappers.py
   . Add documentation

! 2009-07-14 - Juan Palacios
