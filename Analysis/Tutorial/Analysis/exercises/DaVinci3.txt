Add the Phi->KK channel to your selection from Exercise 1
  - Rather than writing another DVAlgorithm that would be very similar to the
    previous one, let's adapt the existing code so that it can
    do both J/psi->mumu and Phi->KK
    - Add an option "Particle" that allows you to choose the mother 
    - The choice of the daughters is done by the ParticleFilter...
    
  - This time you need to give an instance name to either (or both) 
    of your algorithms
    - We suggest "TutorialAlgorithm/Jpsi2MuMu" and "TutorialAlgorithm/Phi2KK".
    - You can run them in any order, but J/psi's being more rae than 
      Phi's it's faster if you run Phi2KK only if Jpsi2MuMu has found something.
      This is automatic in a GaudiSequencer.
      Add 
         TutorialSeq.IgnoreFilterPassed = true ; // get all Phis
      if you want the sequencer to always execute Phi2KK.

General tips:
    - Make sure all your global variables are initialised in the constructor
    - Avoid hard-coding as much as possible
    - Avoid duplication of code. Make methods when necessary.
