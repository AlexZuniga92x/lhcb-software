In this exercise you'll start to write an algorithm that fills an nTuple.

Create a new algorithm "TutorialNtuple" and don't forget to add it to
the _load.cpp file. Remember that DVAlgorithm is a GaudiTupleAlg.
 
   - Get a Tuple (actually a pointer) in the execute method
   - Get the Bs and loop over them
   - Store the mass and momentum of the B in the Tuple
 
   - Include the proper options to run the L0 and L1 and HLT before your sequence.
   - Get the TrgDecision class and store the L0 and L1 and HLT decisions in the Tuple.
   - Get the L1Score and HltScore class and store the decision bits in the Tuple.
 
   - Include the standard options for the BtaggingTool from
     $FLAVOURTAGGINGROOT/options/BTaggingTool.opts
   - Use the flavourTagging() method to get the Bs flavour and store it in the Tuple.
