Write a minimal selection for the decay J/Psi -> MuMu
  - Put all your algorithms in a GaudiSequencer
  - Use the Standard PreloadParticles algorithm to make particles
  - Write a DVAlgorithm "TutorialAlgorithm" that makes J/psi->mumu
    - Make sure you have the doxygen documentation of DVAlgorithm
    - Use emacs to create the .cpp and .h files and tell it to make a DVAlgorithm
    - Get the Particles from the desktop
    - Use the ParticleFilter to extract muons
    - Select dimuons in a reasonable mass window around the J/psi
    - Use the unconstrained vertex fitter, cut on chi^2
    - Do not hard-code the cuts. They should be properties of your algorithm.
    - Use the ParticleStuffer to make the J/psi
    - And give it back to the desktop
    - Then add some histograms
  - Get DC04 Bs->J/psi DST data to run on.

General tips:
    - Make sure all your global variables are initialised in the constructor
    - Avoid hard-coding as much as possible
    - Avoid duplication of code. Make methods when necessary.

The Tutorial package already provides a complete requirements file and the 
"TutorialAlgorithm" is declared to Analysis_load.cpp
