! Package     : MicroDST
! Responsible : Ulrich Kerzel

! 2007-04-12 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - change Warning() into debug() if storing user-created
   primary vertex failed - most likely, it hadn't been created
   by the user


! 2007-04-12 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - in TestDST: print some track-related information,
   move information about daughter into 'PrintParticleInfo'
   to descent the whole chain

! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - assume rootOnTes() ends with a "/", edit TestDST accordingly


! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - remove from microDST.opt
   DSTStream.OptItemList      = {"/Event/Link/Rec/Track/Best#1"};



! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - CreateMicroDSTAlg
  change sub-routine "StoreParticle" from StatusCode ... to LHCb::Particle *...
  returning clone of the particle passed as argument.
  Makes the handling of checking whether the daughters are already in the TES
  easier als the check in now done only inside at the beginning of this routine
  (and not also in another time when considering the daughters)



! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - CreateMicroDSTMCAlg
   new templated function StoreLink to store a link between
   the cloned object and corresponding MC particle



! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel

 - CreateMicroDSTAlg
   clone/store calorimeter information accessed via proto-particle
   or set SmartRef (default) depending on alg.-property
   Some Calorimeter information is accessible via extraInfo in
   the proto-particle itself, thus by default just store SmartRef

-  TestDST
   put loops into smaller sub-routines

- CreateMicroDSTMCAlg
  initial revision - not yet to be used for physics analyses
  - clone and store all directly associated particles/vertices
  - do not follow all links up and down the chain of the particles/vertices
    involved: would copy over many objects -> set SmartRef instead and
    have property in case the user wants it


! 2007-02-16 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - let PhysDesktop handle all input locations
   -> fixes issue with relatedPV() when creating microDST
 - write linker table for particle -> PV to
   /Event/Link/<prefix=microDST>/LHCb::RecVertex::Primary

! 2007-02-15 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - initial revision of MicroDST package.
   Its purpose is to write out all "interesting" B candidates, etc. selected
   by the user into a new DST file which allows then much faster re-analysis
   do to its significant smaller size focus on only the few quantities of
   interest. SmartRefs to the orignial DSTs are preserved, i.e. no information
   is lost.

   N.B. THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT YET TO BE USED FOR PHYSICS ANALYSES

   The following does not yet work:
   - accessing calorimeter information via the proto-particle
   - read in relation between particle and primary vertex
