- The package OTMonitor consists of 3 algorithms:
   OTTimeChecker - Checking the efficiencies with respect to MCHits.
   OTTimeMonitor - Monitoring the OTTime 
   MCOTDepositMonitor - Monitoring the MCOTDeposit    
- Base class: 
   OTMonitorAlgorithm 
  
  Beacause of backward incompatibility, 
  in order to use this package it is necessary to:
  Use LHCbKernel    upper than v5r1
  Use OTEvent       upper than v13r0
  Use OTDAQ         upper than v2r0
  Use OTAssociators upper than v2r9
  Use OTSimulation  instead of OTAlgorithms
