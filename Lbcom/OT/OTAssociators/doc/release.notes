 - Added flag decide to store the relation of OTClusters with 
   MCHits/MCParticles from spillover.
 - This flag is set to false: no relation with spillover is stored.

! 2002-07-4 - Rutger Hierck
 -  Added a associcator between OTCluster and OTMCDeposit.
    This is to find the right ambiguity.
      - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCDepositAsct.h
      - OTCluster2MCDepositAlg

! 2002-06-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Chanve version to v2r0 to use EventKernel v2r*

!========================= OTAssociators v1r0 2002-05-27 ================
! 2002-05-27 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Use more standard TDS path for location of relations tables
 - Add relation factories to OTAssociators_load.cpp

! 2002-05-27 J. van Tilburg
  This is a new package to associate the Outer Tracker classes with 
  Monte Carlo information.
  Two algorithms to build the relations:
  - OTCluster2MCHitAlg
  - OTCluster2MCParticleAlg
  Two associator tools:
  - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCHitAsct.h
  - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCParticleAsct.h
