! 2002-10-16 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - The associators are now able to have more than one
   deposits/hits/particles associated to one cluster. Deposits (or hits or
   particles) which are lost due to dead time can be recovered when they
   are within a given time-window from the first deposit.
 - This time window can be set with a job-option.

!====================== OTAssociators v2r1 2002-10-04 ======================
! 2002-09-26 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - OTCluster2MCHitAlg now makes use of OTCluster2MCDepositAlg.

! 2002-08-07 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added class descriptions.
 - removed log messages.

!====================== OTAssociators v2r0 2002-07-09 =======================
! 2002-07-05 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added flag decide to store the relation of OTClusters with 
   MCHits/MCParticles from spillover.
 - This flag is set to false: no relation with spillover is stored.

! 2002-07-4 - Rutger Hierck
 -  Added a associcator between OTCluster and OTMCDeposit.
    This is to find the right ambiguity.
      - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCDepositAsct.h
      - OTCluster2MCDepositAlg

! 2002-06-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Chanve version to v2r0 to use EventKernel v2r*

!========================= OTAssociators v1r0 2002-05-27 ================
! 2002-05-27 - Marco Cattaneo

  This is a new package to associate the Outer Tracker classes with 
  Monte Carlo information.
  Two algorithms to build the relations:
  - OTCluster2MCHitAlg
  - OTCluster2MCParticleAlg
  Two associator tools:
  - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCHitAsct.h
  - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCParticleAsct.h
