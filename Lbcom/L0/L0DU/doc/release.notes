  Initial release of the package.
  Choice type(s) of L0 trig. 
  The candidates are of type L0CaloCandidate and of type L0MuonCandidate;
  only the muon with the greatest absolute energy is conserved.
  Two energies of cut and one data of scaling for each candidate.
  The first energy is always used; 
  the second energy is used  only if data scaling is greater than 0.
  The choice is condensed in one object of type L0DUReport.
