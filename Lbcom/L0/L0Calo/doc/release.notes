Package		: L0/L0Calo
Package Manager : Olivier Callot

! 2002-11-21 - Olivier Callot
 - For global pi0, perform ghost cleaning, i.e. don't add the two clusters
   if they share a cell.
 - Do global Pi0 also if the card is empty: The next may be not, and the total
   may be a good candidate, as the next may have no neighbour. Small effect !
 - Technical changes: log->msg, use 'format' instead of msg.width().
 - Photon trigger was and is EXCLUSIVE from electron trigger, i.e. when the Prs
   is ON, the candidate is either an electron (SPD ok) or a photon. As the 
   electron trigger has a lower threshold, this doesn't change the trigger 
   rate. But do not select photon trigger exclusively for photon physics !

! 2002-11-19 - Olivier Callot
 - Use the full calorimeter containers to start from the complete digits.
 - Add a Prs validation for the local pi0: At least one of the 4 cells.
 - Some obsolete code has been cleaned up.

!========================= L0Calo v6r2 2002-11-14 =======================
! 2002-11-14 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Force recompilation with CaloEvent v11r3

!========================= L0Calo v6r1 2002-07-18 =======================
! 2002-07-18 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Force recompilation with CaloEvent v11r1
 - Remove an INFO message

!========================= L0Calo v6r0 2002-07-09 =======================
! 2002-07-01 - Olivier Callot
 - New algorithm L0CaloToMCParticleAsct to build the relation between the
   L0CaloCandidates (electron, photon, pi0local, hadron and hadron2) and 
   MCParticle. This is based on the activeE from the hits, and a minimal 
   fraction of the sum is needed, default 10%, jobOption MinimalFraction
   The relation is stored in Rec/Relations/L0CaloCandidates which can be
   changed by jobOption OutputTable.

! 2002-06-25 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Use CaloDet v5r*

! 2002-06-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Change version to v6r0 to use EventKernel v2r*

!======================== L0Calo v5r0 2002-04-19 =========================
! 20020419 (M.Cattaneo)
  - Use AIDA v2r* (for Gaudi v10)

! 15/04/2002 - Olivier Callot
  - Add the SpdMult computation in L0CaloCandidate

! 05/04/2002 - Olivier Callot
  - Changes ObjectVector<CaloDigit> to CaloDigits in L0CaloDigit.cpp

! 04/04/2002 - Olivier Callot
  - Modified to adapt to L0Event v11r0, i.e. changed namespace L0:: to L0Calo::
  - Adapted for the new Calo Event model v10r0

!=============================================================================
! 01/02/2002 - Olivier Callot  ** v4r0 **
  - Use the default TES location from the Event class header files

!=============================================================================
! 30/01/2002 - Olivier Callot
  - Modified to use the new L0Event v10, based on xml.
  - Split the L0Calo algorithm :
    o L0CaloDigit (new) which produces the 8 bit Et and 1 bit Prs/Spd, in the 
      new event classes L0CaloAdc and L0PrsSpdHit
    o L0CaloAlg uses these classes to perfrom the same job as before.
  - Updated options/Brunel.opts for this new algorithm
  - Added options/DaVinci.opts to hold the DaVinci options.
  - Removed the L0Calo directory and its include L0CaloCandidate.h, which is
    now in Event/L0Event.

!=============================================================================
! 2002/01/08 - Marco Cattaneo ** v3r0 **
  Changes for Gaudi v9 and Calo v3:
  requirements      - use CaloEvent v7r*, CaloDet v3r*, AIDA v1r*
  L0CaloAlg.cpp     - get includes from CaloKernel instead of CaloGen
                      change default data container names to Digits (was Digit)
                      use recommended short names for service accessors
  L0CaloCandidate.h - get includes from CaloKernel instead of CaloGen
  L0CaloMonit.h     - get IHistogram1D.h from AIDA instead of GaudiKernel
!=============================================================================
! 12/07/2001 - Olivier Callot ** v2 **
  - Adapt to the new Gaudi/LHCb/Calo release: Increase version numbers and 
    remove buildCells / buildCards calls as this is now done automatically

!=============================================================================
! 12/06/2001 - Olivier Callot
  - New algorithm L0CaloMonit to fill histograms of the L0Calo trigger
  - New source file CLIDL0CaloCandidate.h for clean separation of CLID.
  - Added an SPD fixed threshold, as converted-DST are not properly Z-sup for
    the SPD. Because the SICBDST format has a single bank for Prs/Spd.

!==============================================================================
! 10/05/2001 - Olivier Callot
  Remove the HCAL clusters, no longer needed for Super-L1
  Correct some misuse of MsgStream, 
  provide a << operator to print L0CaloCandidate 

! 2001/04/30 - Olivier Callot
  Modified requirements to use Event/CaloEvent v5* which is already in DEV
 
! 2001/04/25 - Olivier Callot
  A cluster ID may be one of a non-existent cell. In this case the conversion
  to position is done with the other corner of the cluster

! 2001/04/19 - Olivier Callot
  Added the HCAL candidates in the output container, with a new type
  Fixed Windows NT incompatibilities, mainly loop indices are defined outside 
        the loop

! 2001/03/20 - Olivier Callot
  Change the code to have Doxygen compatible comments
  Add a typedef for L0CaloCandidateVector
  Fix the Streambuffer for the HepPoint3D member, i.e. read/write 3 coordinates

! 2001/03/07 - Olivier Callot
  Initial release of the package.
