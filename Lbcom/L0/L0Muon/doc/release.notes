Package L0Muon
Package manager: A.Tsaregorodtsev

!====================================v5========================================
! 20020506 - L0Muon v5r0 Andrei Tsaregorodtsev
  Major modifications of the Muon trigger code to adapt to the
  new Event model and to use new MuonDigits based on MuonTileID:
  - MuonTile and MuonLayout classes are moved to Muon/MuonKernel package;
  - L0MuonCandidate is moved to Event/L0Event package;
  - Single L0mTrigger algorithm left, essentially what was L0mTriggerProcD
    algorithm in the past;
  - Removed all the files used to build L0mPads from the output of the old
    MuonSicbCnv.  

!====================================v4========================================
! 20020108 - L0Muon v4r0 Marco Cattaneo
  Changes for Gaudi v9:
  requirements       - use DetDesc v9r*, LHCbEvent v12r*
  MuonLogicalPad.cpp - adapt to changes in MuonDigit accessors
  MuonPadLayout.cpp  - adapt to changes in MuonDigit accessors
                       add fix for Windows compilation 
!====================================v3r1======================================
! 20010726 - L0Muon v3r1 Marco Cattaneo 

  Fixes for Windows:
  - Add include files for static declaration of CLIDs
  - Add missing factory declarations

!====================================v3========================================
! 12/07/2001 - Olivier Callot
  - Change the version in the requirements to adapt to the new Gaudi/LHCb 
    release
    
! 20010606 L0Muon v2r1 A.T.   

  - Added "Limited Y" search in stations M4 and M5;
  - All the Processing Units are configured once at the initialisation step;
  - Fixed bug in the CreateTower procedure for the cases of crossing the
    boundary between regions;
  - All the numbering for quarters/regions/indices starts from 0.
  - many minor code improvements.   

!==============================================================================
! 20010606 L0Muon v2 A.T.

  Major revision of all the code. A detailed ( including crates
  and processing units ) version of the trigger processor is
  included. 
  The library is subdivided into component and static parts.

! 20010503 L0Muon v1r1 A.T.

  Same functionality.
  Revision of the code to bring it to conformance with conventions.
  Extra checks of container pointers validity. Reimplementation of
  several methods to optimize efficiency:
  
    MuonLayout.tiles(), L0mTriggerProc.createTower()

! 20010418 M.Cattaneo
  requirements - replace {} with () in macro to please nmake, 
                 use LHCbEvent v10*

! 20010406 L0Muon v1

  Initial version of the L0Muon - L0 Muon trigger simulation.
  The package builds L0MuonCandidate objects as the output.
