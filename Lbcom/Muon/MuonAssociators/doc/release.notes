! Responsible : David Hutchcroft

!===================== MuonAssociators v1r2 2004-04-13 =====================
! 2004-04-13 - Alessia Satta
 - Fix to reject link between coords and mcparticles from spillover events
 	
! 2003-12-16 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Move to Gaudi v14

!===================== MuonAssociators v1r1 2003-06-17 =====================
! 2003-01-17 - Sebastien Ponce
 - support for gcc 3.2

!====================== MuonAssociators v1r0 2002-07-09 =====================
! 2002-07-04 - David Hutchcroft
 - Added a test that the MCParticle is in the nominal event (not spillover)
 - removed now unnesscary test on the Origin vertex of the MCParticle

! 2002-07-03 - David Hutchcroft
 - Modified the code a little to make some scoping explicit. 
 - MuonCoord2MCParticleAlg no long uses the MuonDigit2MCParticle table

! 2002-07-02 - David Hutchcroft
 - Changed the code to clear and refill existing tables if the algorithm 
   has already been run
 - Removed an unused option from MuonDigit2MCParticleAlg and renamed the option
   in MuonCoord2MCParticleAlg

! 2002-06-28 - David Hutchcroft
  - First working version of a MuonCoord and MuonDigit to MCParticle 
    associators. 
  - Added unregisterObject to allow the repeated remaking of the 
    table in case of deleted MuonCoords.
  - Added the test that MCParticles have an originVertex, allows the 
    removal of the fake ATMC entries added by the simmubg code.

! 2002-06-12 - David Hutchcroft
  - First attempt at a MuonDigit to MCParticle associator
