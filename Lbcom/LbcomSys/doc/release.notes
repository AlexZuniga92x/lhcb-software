    VeloDAQ v4r4, VeloSimulation v3r6p1

- In L0Calo v9r19
  . src/L0CaloAlg.cpp: in the trigger emulation, do not add ECAL to HCAL 0
    energies when the default HCAL address is not physical (to reflect
    electronics behaviour)
  . src/L0CaloCompare: add a histogram to plot the position of all candidates
    (not only errors) and the BCId where the errors occur.

- In L0DU v8r11
  . L0DUReportMonitor : fix problem with 2D correlation histo -> symmetrical 2D
                        correlation histo instead of (wrong) triangular

  . Minor fix to handle case where the L0Muon bank is not there
  . Remove pt encdong paramter from algorihtm properties
  . Add possibily to emulate TAE events

    new data that can contain errors only for one ppfpga processor
  . Add property for PrepareVeloFullRawBuffer - used when consecutive
    events are analysed  
  . Modified SmartErrorBankDecoder - if there are no error banks detected, it
    continues processing and skips to the next event (plus minor improvement to
    make the code compatible with new RawEvent object)
  . The decoding of full VELO clusters for bank version 3 now checks whether a
    key already exists in the container before insertion.  This is a change in
    policy, not a bug fix.  We will no longer crash in the case of duplicate
    keys.  Instead an error message containing the problematic source ID is 
    issued and all clusters from this source are removed.

    containing default configurations of the DecodeVeloRawBuffer algorithm
    for decoding into VeloLiteClusters or VeloClusters.

    VeloSimulation v7r6

- In L0Muon v7r3
  . Major change to handle different processor versions and bank versions

      by L0MuonAlg)
    o add the L0MuonOutput tool to write/decode L0Muon banks
  . Add the possiblity to start the L0Muon emulator with L0Muon data in input

- In L0DU v7r7

- In STTools v3r3
  . Added double->int cast in STFun::position to remove strange optimization
    issue in comparison a double to an int
  . Replaced > with >=

- In RichDAQ v3r12
  . Remove auto pointers from clustering interfaces in favour of a simple 
    pointer, which the user then 'owns'
  . Update HPD occupancy tool to be able to run with explicit RICH1 or 
    RICH2 setting.
  . use EventID and BXID == and != operators
  . Minor fix to prevent the abortion of an entire L1 bank when one HPD fails
    its RichSmartID lookup. Now only that HPD is rejected but the remaining 
    HPDs in the L1 bank are processed.

- In RichMCTools v3r7
  . Update RichMCTrack info tool to correctly perform aerogel refraction
    correction.

- In RichTools v2r15
  . Adapt to changes in RichGeomPhoton in RichKernel
  . Update the mirror segment finding tool to sort mirrors in order to distance 
    from beamline.

    hypothesis list.

    ray tracing
  . Update default tool mappings in tool registry.
  . Add implementations for two new methods to the RichSmartID tool, 
    anodeGlobalPosition, which return the position for a given RichSmartID 
    or Rich::HPDPixelCluster on the anode pixel chip.

- In VeloDAQ v4r0
  . Add decoding of the non-zero suppressed (NZS) banks added, new code can cope
    with decoding of the VeloFull data bank, PedestalBank and VeloErrorBank.
    Also EvtInfo object, that includes a number of informations critical from 
    point of view of the emulation, can be created. Beetle headers do not
    make a separate data stream but are part of the NZS header bank. The headers
    are also decoded and stored. All decoding routines follow closely appropriate
    EDMS notes describing TELL1 data formats.
  . Make the decoder fail more graciously in case a source ID can not matched to
    a sensor number. Now an error message is issued and the source ID is skipped.
  . Introduced new version 3 of VELO raw buffer.  The only difference to
    version 2 is the treatment of interstrip positions.  These are now computed
    and rounded exactly like on the TELL1 board. Default is still version 2
  . Added proper bank version management to decoder.  The correct decoding is
    determined from the raw bank's version.  The version can also be enforced
    via the ForceBankVersion property (useful for testbeam data).
  . Made sure the decoder creates empty cluster and lite cluster containers on
    the TES even if the raw event is missing or it encounters an unsupported
    bank version.  If a byte count mismatch (corrupted raw bank) is discovered
    during the cluster decoding the clusters from this source ID are removed from
    the container.  Clusters from other source IDs will be still available in
    this case. 

- In VeloSimulation v7r6
  . Modified the treatment of the timing of particle arrivals to correctly 
    implement spillover with the right fractions in each sensor
  . Fixed the unchecked StatusCodes
  . In VeloSim wrapped all message service calls with a test on output level

- In CaloAssociators v6r4

    * update HCAL energy with ECAL in front also if HCAL Et=0
    * for particular cases where Front-End boards are partially used
      (HCAL for example), only transmit data to neighbour cards if
      the connection is physically present and not masked in the hardware.
    * if the candidate's cellID is not valid, use (in this order) the top 
      cellID, the right cellID (if the top is not valid) or the corner cellID 
      (it the right is not valid) instead, to follow what is done in the hardware
  . TriggerCard.cpp: use left bottom valid cell of the board as default address
    when the card has 0 energy deposited in it.

This version is built against LHCb v18r7 and Gaudi v16r4.
- Packages modified: RichTools v1r7, RichMCTools v2r6

- In RichTools v1r7
  . Update mirror segment finder to be more efficient at locating correct mirror
  . Update Photon reconstruction tool (renamed RichPhotonRecoUsingQuarticSoln)
    to allow various bits to be turned off via job options.
    By default, the ambiguous photon test is not performed.
    Also, to use a trimmed down version of the quartic solver which skips
    solution not needed by the RICH

- In RichMCTools v2r6
  . Minor updates to MC navigation

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r2>2005-06-03 LbcomSys v2r2</A></H1><PRE>
This version is built against LHCb v18r6 and Gaudi v16r4.
- Packages added:    KaliMisCalo
- Packages modified: L0DU v6r9p1

- In KaliMisCalo v1r0:
  . Algorithms to miscalibrate CaloDigits, MCCaloDigits, MCCaloHits 

- In L0DU v6r9p1:
  . Add $(L0DUOPTS)/L0.opts, for re-running L0 from DST in DaVinci or Panoramix
  . Remove obosolete Brunel.opts, NotBrunel.opts

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r1>2005-05-24 LbcomSys v2r1</A></H1><PRE>
This version is built against LHCb v18r5 and Gaudi v16r4.

 Repackaging to create RecSys project
 - Packages moved to RecSys: RichRecTools, RichRecMCTools, RichRecCommon,
                             RichRecQC, TrExtrapolator, CaloReco, CaloPIDs
 - Packages added:    ITAlgorithms, ITCheckers, L0Checker
 - Packages modified: L0Calo v8r2

 - In ITAlgorithms v15r0:
   . Remove ITSignalToNoiseTool. Modify algorithms to use ISTSignalToNoiseTool.h
     instead (from STTools package).

 - In ITCheckers v2r5:
   . use ISTSignalToNoiseTool instead of IITSignalToNoiseTool

 - In L0Calo v8r2:
   . Delete RawEvent invalidated by changes to RawBuffer in L0CaloAlg
