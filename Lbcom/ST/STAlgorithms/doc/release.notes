!======================= STAlgorithms v1r0 2006-02-20 ========================

! 2006-02-20
 - some minor bug fixes and tuning
 - also add functionality to STDigitCreator to ensure always have neighbours
   (not used yet) 

! 2006-02-15 - Marco Cattaneo
 - In requirements, migrate to DigiEvent
 - Add also dependency on RecEvent, needed by STSummaryCreator...

! 2006-02-14 M. Needham
 - Bug fixes:
   - options files 
   - MCSTDepositCreator (stupid errors)
   - tune digitization parameters

! 2006-02-08 M. Needham
 - tune/bug fixes in IT options
 - protect against zero charge on strips
