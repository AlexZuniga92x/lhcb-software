!========================  VeloAlgorithms v1r0 2002-07-09 =====================
! 2002-07-07 - Chris Parkes
 - Spillover FEs no longer have their MCVeloHits stored.

! 2002-07-07 - Chris Parkes
 - Remove bug in spillover

! 2002-06-30 - Chris Parkes
 - Adding Rounding function for windows comptibility.
 - Allow possibility of pileup detector simulation in VeloSim

! 2002-06-24 - Chris Parkes
 - add std:: in front of all STL stuff I can find, in order to make 
   compilation windows compatible.

! 2002-06-21 - Olivier Callot
 - Protect against insertion in m_fes_coupling container.

! 2002-06-19 - Marco Cattaneo
 - VeloSim.cpp: missing spillover hits container is not an error

! 2002-06-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Commissioned with VeloDet v6r0. Fixed a problem when merging coupling and
   normal strips. 
 - Created an Option file for Brunel.
 - Fix the conformance to coding standards, mainly the 80 columns limit.

! 09/06/2002 - Chris Parkes  ** v1r0 **
  First release of a test version.
  Algorithms:
       VeloSim - Silicon and FE chip simulation
       VeloDataProcessor - makes VeloFullDigits from MCVeloFEs
       VeloClusterMaker - makes VeloClusters from VeloFullDigits
  also VeloEventFunctor - routines for sorting / comparisons of 
                          Event model objects
  These rely on my private detector element (based on Olivier's),
  so you need to contact me if you want to try them.
