 -  VeloClusterMaker, solve bug to allow setting of S/N cuts, 
    modify defaults to 3.0
 - VeloDataProcessor, saturate ADC at full scale
 - Velo Sim fill FEs with list of MChits contributing 
   i.e. solve ambiguity for multiple hits contributing to a single strip

!========================  VeloAlgorithms v2r1 2002-07-25 =====================
! 2002-07-23 - Chris Parkes
 - solve bug due to sensor number problems
 - sensor number in MCHits is different from sensor number in Detector Element
 - this will eventually be solved when we move to GAUSS
 - make nasty fudge for function requiring hit sensor number (SiThickness).

!========================  VeloAlgorithms v2r0 2002-07-18 =====================

! 2002-07-17 - Chris Parkes
 - fix memory leak problem for case m_pileUp=false 

! 2002-07-11 - Olivier Callot
 - Correct also the sensor number for spill-over of the PuVeto detector.
 - Set the sensor number correctly for noise generation in PileUp Veto.
 - Cleaned the indentation, and broken a few lines, to conform to LHCb coding
   conventions.

! 2002-07-10 - Chris Parkes
 - tuning of diffusion calculation
 - keep -ve signals above fabs(threshold) as well as +ve

! 2002-07-09 - Chris Parkes
 - remove bug in diffusion calculation
 - add very simple charge simulation for testing

!========================  VeloAlgorithms v1r0 2002-07-09 =====================
! 2002-07-09 - Chris Parkes
 - Spillover FEs no longer have their MCVeloHits stored.

! 2002-07-07 - Chris Parkes
 - Remove bug in spillover

! 2002-06-30 - Chris Parkes
 - Adding Rounding function for windows comptibility.
 - Allow possibility of pileup detector simulation in VeloSim

! 2002-06-24 - Chris Parkes
 - add std:: in front of all STL stuff I can find, in order to make 
   compilation windows compatible.

! 2002-06-21 - Olivier Callot
 - Protect against insertion in m_fes_coupling container.

! 2002-06-19 - Marco Cattaneo
 - VeloSim.cpp: missing spillover hits container is not an error

! 2002-06-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Commissioned with VeloDet v6r0. Fixed a problem when merging coupling and
   normal strips. 
 - Created an Option file for Brunel.
 - Fix the conformance to coding standards, mainly the 80 columns limit.

! 09/06/2002 - Chris Parkes  ** v1r0 **
  First release of a test version.
  Algorithms:
       VeloSim - Silicon and FE chip simulation
       VeloDataProcessor - makes VeloFullDigits from MCVeloFEs
       VeloClusterMaker - makes VeloClusters from VeloFullDigits
  also VeloEventFunctor - routines for sorting / comparisons of 
                          Event model objects
  These rely on my private detector element (based on Olivier's),
  so you need to contact me if you want to try them.
