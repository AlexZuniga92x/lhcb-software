! 09/06/2002 - Chris Parkes  ** v1r0 **
  First release of a test version.
  Algorithms:
       VeloSim - Silicon and FE chip simulation
       VeloDataProcessor - makes VeloFullDigits from MCVeloFEs
       VeloClusterMaker - makes VeloClusters from VeloFullDigits
  also VeloEventFunctor - routines for sorting / comparisons of 
                          Event model objects
  These rely on my private detector element (based on Olivier's),
  so you need to contact me if you want to try them.
