!========================= VeloSimulation v3r9 2011-04-27 =========================
! 2011-04-19 - David Hutchcroft
 - Added explicit setting of variables in VeloSim::VeloSim to remove Coventry
   defect 17434 (the variables were set before use so no change in output)

!========================= VeloSimulation v3r8 2010-12-06 =========================
! 2010-12-06 - Tomasz Szumlak
 - change that is a part of the VELO tuning for MC 2011 production
   now the default BiasVoltage is set to 150 V

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r7 2010-03-18 ========================
! 2010-03-05 - David Hutchcroft
 - Removed double->int compilation warning

! 2010-03-04 - David Hutchcroft
 - Changed simulation to match 2009 collision data and TELL1 style cluster 
   maker, gain is lower 601 ADC per electron instead of 442 and smaller noise
 - Added an optimisation to only make isolated MCVeloFEs if they could start a
   cluster, still use inclusion threshold for FEs next to an FE with signal
 - Change timing curve to match data from tests on the cold detector
 - Fix simulation of NZS data to generate gaussian noise not gaussian tail
   noise

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r6p1 2008-11-21 ======================
! 2008-11-06 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix for gcc 4.3

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r6 2008-10-01 ========================
! 2008-09-10 - David Hutchcroft
 - Removed finalize printout of nan when no events processed 

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r5 2008-07-29 ========================
! 2008-07-24 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add a new wrapper inline int safe_int_poissonDist() to protect against 
   FPE in Rndm::Poisson

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r4 2008-07-17 ======================
! 2008-07-10 - David Hutchcroft
 - Changed code to use real bad strip list from DeVeloSensor to kill bad strips
   Changed VeloSim.opts to make 1% bad strips in pileup (random) and only 
   known bad strips dead in main VELO. 
   Tweaked code for gsl_sf_erf_Q wrapper to reduced unnecessary calls

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r3 2008-07-04 ======================
! 2008-07-04 - David Hutchcroft
 - Added an FPE protection wrapper to gsl_sf_erf_Q to remove FPE when audited
   Code caused inexact and underflow FPEs but was working correctly

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r2 2008-06-04 ======================
! 2008-06-04 - David Hutchcroft
 - Change the sensitivity and error serverity for the charge normalisation
   error.

! 2008-06-04 - David Hutchcroft
 - Fixed a divide by zero and sqrt(-N) problem when PrevPrev MCHits gave 
   either zero or negative charge deposition

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r1 2008-05-19 ======================
! 2008-05-19 - David Hutchcroft
 - Fixed MCHit linking to only link to main event container
 - Fixed PU veto input data in options
 - Changed text in VeloSimMoni to reflect linker change

!===================== VeloSimulation v3r0 2008-04-18 ======================
! 2007-04-18 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix Windows compilation ("round" is not in <cmath>, use LHCb::Math::round)

! 2008-04-14 - David Hutchcroft
 - Removed NextNext from default opts
 - Use one cached poisson generator instead of making 88 per event 
 - Changed the label on the signal and other lines of VeloSimMoni

! 2008-04-14 - David Hutchcroft
 - Retuned time curves to use vfp = 150 and vfs = 550 : best guess as inital 
   BEETLE tune parameters, amount of spillover increased
 - Offset sampling time to get equal amplification to Prev and Next MCHits
 - Added PrevPrev and NextNext to simulation by default
 - Corrected noise simulation otherwise empty strips
 - Set capacitve coupling to 1% (from 5%) to get approx 1 and 2 strip 
   ratio about right

! 2008-03-28 - David Hutchcroft
 - Update to VeloSim
 - Use ST charge deposite tool to correct GEANT dEdx
 - Use ST amplifier response tool to simulate amplifier response verse time
 - Allow a list of input containers via options with time offsets
 - Default to prev, main and next in VeloSim.opts
 - Allow a list of output locations (for the PileUp modules which write to two)
 - Simulate noise from the DeVeloSensor->stripNoise() distribution per strip
 - Added options to convert from noise in ADC to noise in electrons

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r7 2008-03-11 ======================
! 2008-03-10 - David Hutchcroft
 - Removed calls to phiOfStrip and trgPhiOfStrip in VeloSimMoni.cpp and now
   removed from DeVeloPhiType.h

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r6 2007-09-07 ======================
! 2007-09-05 - David Hutchcroft

   implement spillover with the right fractions in each sensor

! 2006-05-29 - Tomasz Szumlak
  The version is able to produce non-zero suppressed simulated data
  needed for studies on TELL1 algorithms

   VeloChargeThreshold class
