! Package     : Velo/VeloSimulation
! Responsible : Tomasz Szumlak
! Purpose     : 
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2008-03-28 - David Hutchcroft
 - Update to VeloSim
 - Use ST charge deposite tool to correct GEANT dEdx
 - Use ST amplifier response tool to simulate amplifier response verse time
 - Allow a list of input containers via options with time offsets
 - Default to prev, main and next in VeloSim.opts
 - Allow a list of output locations (for the PileUp modules which write to two)
 - Simulate noise from the DeVeloSensor->stripNoise() distribution per strip
 - Added options to convert from noise in ADC to noise in electrons

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r7 2008-03-11 ======================
! 2008-03-10 - David Hutchcroft
 - Removed calls to phiOfStrip and trgPhiOfStrip in VeloSimMoni.cpp and now
   removed from DeVeloPhiType.h

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r6 2007-09-07 ======================
! 2007-09-05 - David Hutchcroft
 - Modified the treatment of the timing of particle arrivals to correctly 
   implement spillover with the right fractions in each sensor
 - Fixed the unchecked StatusCodes
 - In VeloSim wrapped all message service calls with a test on output level

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r5 2007-03-05 ======================
! 2007-03-05 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove obsolete VeloSimulation_load.cpp file

! 2007-02-28 - Tomasz Szumlak
 - Bug fix - get rid of biased residuals

! 2007-02-26 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove LHCbDefinitions includes

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r4 2006-06-15 ======================
! 2006-06-15 - Tomasz Szumlak
 - Changes for test beam simulation

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r3 2006-05-29 ======================
! 2006-05-29 - Tomasz Szumlak
  The version is able to produce non-zero suppressed simulated data
  needed for studies on TELL1 algorithms
 - predicate functor's been removed from VeloSim.cpp and implemented as
   VeloChargeThreshold class
 - routine for pedestal simulation in each Velo channel has been added
 - simulation of noise and removal of MCVeloFEs with charge below 4500
   electrons is governed by m_makeNonZeroSuppressed flag

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r2p1 2006-05-17 ======================
! 2006-05-17 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Adapt to Gaudi::Units

! 2006-05-11 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Trivial fix in VeloSim.cpp to avoid a name clash with windows.h. Also, 
   remove some unneccessary includes.

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r2 2006-04-05 ========================
! 2006-04-05 - Tomasz Szumlak
 - clean-up the simulation code to DC06 release
 - checking of the conditions data base if given sensor is read-out added
 - fix pulseShape loop

! 2006-03-28 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Backwards compatible fixes to compile with Gaudi v18r3

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r1 2006-03-23 =====================
! 2006-03-17 - Mark Tobin and Kurt Rinnert
 - Adapt to use new DeVelo interface

!===================== VeloSimulation v2r0 2006-03-07 =====================
! 2006-03-10 - Tomasz Szumlak

! 2006-02-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove VeloSimulation directory
 - Pickup from LHCbKernel interfaces previously in VeloAlgorithms 
 - Various minor cleanups

! 2006-02-08 - Tomasz Szumlak
 - migration of the code to LHCb v20r0
 - spillOver estimation using pulse shape fit coming from data
   taken during the Beam Tests in 2004
 - hard coded sensor number removed
 - new VeloSimMoni algorithm added
 - some additional code clean-up
