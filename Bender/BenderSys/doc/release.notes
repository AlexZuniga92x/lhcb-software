<A NAME=v8r3>2008-06-12 Bender v8r3 based on the DaVinci v19r13 </A>
</H1>	

<PRE>		
This version is based on DaVinci v19r13.
Some usage of "Configurables" is introduced.

Important:

The module Bender.Main does *NOT* define anymore the symbol gaudi.
One needs to instantiate it explicitly: "gaudi = appMgr() "
