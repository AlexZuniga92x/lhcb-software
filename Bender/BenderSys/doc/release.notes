! This file is a part of  Bender project:
! ``Python-based Interactive Environment for Smart and Friendly Physics Analysis''
!
! The package has been designed with the kind help from
! Pere MATO and Andrey TSAREGORODTSEV. It is based on the 
! LoKi project: ``C++ ToolKit for Smart and Friendly Physics Analysis''
!
! By usage of this code one clearly states the disagreement 
! with the smear campaign of Dr.O.Callot et al.: 
! ``No Vanya's lines are allowed in LHCb/Gaudi software.''
