! This file is a part of  Bender project:
! ``Python-based Interactive Environment for Smart and Friendly Physics Analysis''
!
! The package has been designed with the kind help from
! Pere MATO and Andrey TSAREGORODTSEV. It is based on the 
! LoKi project: ``C++ ToolKit for Smart and Friendly Physics Analysis''
!
! By usage of this code one clearly states the disagreement 
! with the smear campaign of Dr.O.Callot et al.: 
! ``No Vanya's lines are allowed in LHCb/Gaudi software.''

<PRE>		
It is rather similar to v22r3, but based on fresh DaVinci picking up 
all goodies and bug-fixes.

Other features: 

<li>	
The direct access to GRID-files has been restored. 
</li>	

<li>	
Functionality to get DB-tags form data files has been totally 
rewritten. Now it is a little bit slower, but does not rely on internals of ROOT, 
and in this way it is more geeneric, flexible and much easier 
to debug in case of problems (e.g. with GRID access). 
</li>	

<li>	
From now Bender-based standard scripts can be blindly applied to (x)gen files. 
This functionality is available through 
new module GenFiles.pym that makes some polishing of 
Data-On-Demand service, suppression soem actions 
not needed for processing (x)gen files. 
</li>	

<li>	
Many tiny improvements for standard Bender-based scripts
</li>	

<li>	
Restore the configuration for processing of ancient 
Stripping13b uDST files with new software stack.
</li>	

<li>	
Some helper (experimenta) functionality from Phys/DiCharm is added.
</li>

All Bender-bases scripts have got the new option "-g" to activate 
access to data files through Grid-URL, requires valid lhcb-proxy. This
option has the precedence over "-c" (castor&EOS). 
</li>	

<li>	
New scripts to extract DB-tags directly from data  
(many thanks tpo Thomas RUF).
I tis very useful for MC-processing.
Unfortunately it does not work for uDST
</li>	

<li>	
All bender-base scripts (explored, check, dump, etc..) for MC data 
try to set DB-tags directly form the files

</H1>	

<PRE>		
The version is rather similar  to v17r4, but it is based on fresh DaVinci v29r0
and thus in this way it picks up many goodies and fixes.

<li>
It also contains many useful fixes for dst-explorer, 
in particular (if available)
it accepts the bare LFNs for input.
<li>
It also contains new useful script trg-check for fast cheking of trigger lines,
e.g. get the list of relevalt Tis/Tos lines for given selection
<li>
It also picks up the extention of very useful Juan's functions for 
configurtaion of root-in-tes for MicroDst processing.
This configuration is done in 100% backward compatible way 
and applicable for all stripping rounds starting 
from 13b (including).
In particular it copies/links ODIN, RawEvent, RecSummary and few other 
objects into stream-specific location, making thye uDST analysis very 
easy and transparent, e.g. there is no need to specify the ugly 
default arguments for HASRECSUMMARY/RECSUMMARY functors..
<li>
To use all these goodies one should <b>NOT</b> activate DaVinci 
property "UseTrigRawEvent"
