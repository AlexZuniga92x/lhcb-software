Package: DAQEvent
Author: Jose' Helder Lopes
Purpose: Define the L1Buffer,  L1Event, L1Bank, HLTBuffer, HLTEvent and 
         HLTBank classes.

!=============== DAQEvent v1r1 2003-10-03 =============================
! 2003-10-03 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add constructors HLTEvent( HLTBuffer& ) and L1Event( L1Buffer& )

!=============== DAQEvent v1r0 22-09-2003 =============================
  - DAQTypes.h: Header file with typedef's for hlt_int (32 bits) and l1_int 
                (16 bits) types.

  - L1Buffer:   Holds event size(s) information and a buffer(raw array of l1_int)
                with the data for L1 trigger. Serialize and fillStream methods 
                not implemented yet. Header word with source (7 bits), class 
                (2 bits) and size (7 bits) info for each data bank.

  - L1Event:    Scan the L1 buffer and save a std::vector of L1Banks for each
                different class_ID found in the TES.

  - L1Bank:     Holds the size and the pointer to the data in L1 buffer for each
                data bank

  - HLTBuffer:  Holds event size(s) information and a buffer(raw array of hlt_int)
                with the data for HLT, following the Online Data Format prescription
                (LHCb note 2001-097). Should be filled at the end of the 
                digitization phase for each detector sub-system. Serialize and 
                fillStream methods not implemented yet. Transport header and tail
                not implemented.
      
  - HLTEvent:   Scan the HLT buffer and makes a std::vector of HLTBanks for each
                different class_ID found. 
	      
  - HLTBank:    Holds the size and the pointer to the data in HLT buffer for each
                data bank
