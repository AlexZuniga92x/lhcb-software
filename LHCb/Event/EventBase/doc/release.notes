! Package     : Event/EventBase
! Responsible : Marco Cattaneo, Gloria Corti
! Purpose     : LHCb Event model

! 2005-11-15 - Gloria CORTI
 - Change package name to EventBase in *.xml, for GOD Reflex dict generation

! 2005-09-06 - P. Koppenburg
 - Split package Event/Event into Event/MCEvent and Event/EventBase because 
 	 . Packages called Foo/Foo cause problems in cvs
   . Everything was depending on it which is not that nice since it contains
     MCParticle for instance
