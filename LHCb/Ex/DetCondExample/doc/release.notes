Package Ex/DetCondExample
Package manager : Andrea Valassi 

==============================================================================
!20020725 - Andrea Valassi
Upgrade to CondDBOracle v4r15 and Gaudi v10r4
- Dependency on Det/DetCond changed from v3r0 to v4r0
- No major changes to the code, just test that everything is OK
  > produce new reference log files
  > added a new "DAQ" example using the CondDB to measure writing speed
- Updated documentation
  > no changes to CLHEP necessary anymore (RH7 libraries now available)
  > MsgStream modification is now released in GaudiKernel v12r3
  > lxplus7 has been setup (replaces tbed0087/88/89)

Requirements v4r0, private tag h20020725

==============================================================================
!20020717 - Andrea Valassi
Observed a potential problem. No change to the code.
- If you source setup from a directory other than cmt/, CMT seems to look
  for the setup/cleanup scripts in mgr/ rather than cmt/ sometimes.
  This had never been observed before: has something changed in CMT/LHCb
  or do I need to fix it somehow? It seems difficult to reproduce.

==============================================================================
!20020712 - Andrea Valassi
Minor modifications to the documentation

==============================================================================
!20020506 - Andrea Valassi
Upgrade to Gaudi v10r1 (GaudiKernel v12r2)

Requirements v3r0, private tag h20020506

==============================================================================
!20020417 - Andrea Valassi
Upgrade to Gaudi v10

!20020408 - Andrea Valassi
A few changes in setup_Redhat72.csh as default CMT on Linux is now v1r11.
- This allows to simplify setup_Redhat72.csh with respect to that for v1r9
  > previously: default was v1r9, setup_Redhat72.csh set v1r10p20011126
  > now: default is v1r11, setup_Redhat72.csh keeps v1r11
Also a minor bug fix in dropCondDB.sql.

!20020328 - Andrea Valassi
First Oracle implementation ported to Linux (RedHat 7.2 only)
See doc/README.RedHat72 in Ex/DetCondExample for more details
Corresponds to Emil's first official release of ConditionsDB (0.3.1.0)
- Det/DetCond depends on Det/CondDBOracle v3r10 for WIN32
- Det/DetCond depends on Det/CondDBOracle v3r10 for rh72_gcc29521
- Det/DetCond depends on CONDDB v3r02           for rh61_gcc29521
Minor changes to configuration scripts and logfiles
- Run appropriate setup and cleanup scripts for Oracle/Objectivity
- Include logfiles for all 3 platforms (Windows, Linux61, Linux72)
- Include logfiles for tests of Oracle across platforms (write on A, read on B)
Requirements v2r1, private tag h20020328.

==============================================================================
!20020301 - Andrea Valassi
First version running on Windows (using the Oracle implementation of CONDDB)
- Both examples now run under both Windows and Linux
  > the Xml example (unchanged)
  > the CondDB example (previously working only under Linux)
- Some useful scripts introduced for Oracle as .sql files
- Proper setup and cleanup scripts introduced for Windows as .bat files
- The Oracle example uses a remote server: username/password are needed
- Minor changes in folder names
  > a prefix /CONDDB is used as the root folder of the CondDB structure
- Minor changes in messaging
  > debug the hex notation of longlong printout
  > introduce also a dec notation of longlong printout
  > extensive checks for __int64 data type
Requirements v2r1, private tag h20020301.

==============================================================================
!20011220 - Andrea Valassi
Simplify dependencies on the Gaudi framework.

==============================================================================
!20011216 - Andrea Valassi
Major changes due to tighter coordination with DetDesc and XmlDDDB packages.
- There are now two examples (with three separate job option files)
  > an Xml example that works both under Windows and under Linux
  > a CondDB exmple that works only under Linux
- A simple DDDB based on Xml files is released in directory XMLDDDB
- Conditions stored in the CondDB are now proper XML documents
  > read conversion from XML strings is handled by the XmlCnvSvc
  > write conversion into XML strings is still done by hand in PopulateDB
- The basic DataObject stored in the CondDB is now called Condition
  > class ConditionData is removed
- There is not an example of a derived condition
  > previously Temperature was used
  > is Condition generic enough that one should not derive another class?
  > writing derived condition is some work in overloading Cnv and update()
- Changes in folder description
  > classID are removed from all XML refs: remove it from folder description
  > assume that secondary storage type is always read from folder description
- Various changes in which detector elements are used for tests
  > Ecal is used to test all kinds of conditions in XML files
  > LHCb and Hcal are used to test slow control data in the CondDB
    - using XML strings created ad hoc by PopulateDB
  > LHCb is used to test geometry data in the CondDB
    - transferring an XML file into the CondDB
    - taking care that the DTD location must be internally reinterpreted
- Different notation for the condition folders:
  > folder /SlowControl/Ecal corresponds to TDS path /dd/SlowControl/Ecal
  > this and all other links are set in the XML files
  > no need to use BootDetectorStore anymore
- Remove ConditionsDBAddress (a GenericAddress of type CONDDB is enough)
  > also XMLSTRING storage type is not needed anymore
  > if the "file name" begins by "<xml?" it is reinterpreted as an XML string
- An improved DetDataAgent is used (specifying which DataObjects are loaded)
  > while DumpDetectorStore is removed
- Algorithm names are not changed in the job options anymore
- Various changes in messaging
  > simpler code using private methods in PopulateDB
  > test also the browseInTag iterator from the CondDB package
  > take INFO as default, use DEBUG only for more information, consistently
  > use VERBOSE tag for very verbose comments
  > use hex notation for all long long times
  > use more intuitive time intervals and temperature values for the example
Requirements v2r0, private tag h20011216.

==============================================================================
!20011130 - Andrea Valassi
Use the new DetectorDataSvc in GaudiSvc.
- Contains main features of ConditionDataSvc and ConditionsDBDataSvc
- Remove ConditionDataSvc and ConditionsDBDataSvc

==============================================================================
!20011129 - Andrea Valassi
- Remove the IConditionsDBDataSvc special interface
- BootDetectorStore bootstraps the detector data store 
  > the association between folder names and path names is done here
  > objects are registered using standard methods (need ForceLeaves=true)
- TestSmartDataPtr needs not call the IConditionsDBDataSvc to boot the store
  > only TDS path names are used
- TestConditionsDBDataSvc has internal methods to test a normal data service
  > only TDS path names are used

==============================================================================
!20011128 - Andrea Valassi
- Move the global tag from the ConditionsDBDataSvc to the ConditionsDBCnvSvc

==============================================================================
!20011127 - Andrea Valassi
- Move interface IDetDataSvc (formerly IConditionDataSvc) to GaudiKernel

==============================================================================
!20011123 - Andrea Valassi
Upgrade to Gaudi v9
- Addresses now inherit from GenericAddress (which has been simplified a lot)
- There are no address factories any more
- Add method createAddress in XmlStringCnvSvc
- Adapt to changes in RegistryEntry (which now implements IRegistry)
- Do not overload methods createObj and updateObj in XmlStringCnvSvc
- Add dummy methods fillObjRefs and updateObjRefs in ConditionsDBCnvSvc
