 - New tool CaloReadoutTool for a description of the cards and readout, 1 MHz version
 - Implementation of the proposed 1 MHz coding, with packing instead of
   zero suppression. Starts from EcalFull and HcalFull digit containers
   Affects CaloFillRawBuffer and CaloFillPrsSpdRawBuffer. Note that this coding is 
   NOT the default, one has to add the options :
    EcalFillRawBuffer.DataCodingType = 2;
    HcalFillRawBuffer.DataCodingType = 2;
    CaloFillPrsSpdRawBuffer.DataCodingType = 3;
 - Process thenew format in the decoding algorithms CaloEnergyFromRaw, CaloTriggerFromRaw, 
   CaloPrsBitFromRaw and CaloSpdBitFromRaw,

 - Adjust the comparison algorithm. New option 'packedRawBuffer' to be set to
   true when using the 1 MHz coding type.

  Decoding speed can be improved by inlining the 'nextCell' method, i.e. changing the
  interface of this package. One could also implement just a begin and end accessor
  to the local array where the unpacking is performed. But this makes visible
  the internal implementation. To be done when the 1 MHz readout becomes the
  baseline scenario.

 - src/CaloReCreateMCLinks.cpp
     1) add new property "IgnoreMode" 
        (the defualt value is "false" )
        to ignore the absence of MC-containers 
        (a warning is printed at the end of the job, but processing is continued)
     2) some consmetics changes 
     3) improve Doxygen comments 
 - src/CaloReCreateMcLinks.h
     remove the file

 - Initialize the base class of CaloEnergyFromRaw, was forgotten.

! 2005-05-04 - Olivier Callot
 - Accesses the RawEvent and not explicitely the RawBuffer while decoding.
 - Avoid a copy of the list of banks when decoding the RawEvent.

 - Tools to decode the Raw buffer: One interface for the trigger and one for
   the energies:
     interface ICaloTriggerFromRaw: 
        CaloPrsBitFromRaw
        CaloSpdBitFromRaw
        CaloTriggerFromRaw
     interface ICaloEnergyFromRaw
        CaloEnergyFromRaw
 - Algorithm CaloDigitsFromRaw (was in CaloEvent) to decode the Raw buffer and
   re-create the CaloDigits
 - Algorithm CompareCaloDigits (was in CaloEvent) to test two codings of the 
   CaloDigits. 
 - Algorithm CaloReCreateMCLinks (was in CaloEvent) to re-create the MCLink for
   the CaloDigit containers.
 - Compared to version in CaloEvent, data coding of Prs/Ecal/Hcal energies is 
   more compact (-1.5 kbyte/event), but thanks to versioning of the RawBuffer 
   banks, the decoding is handling properly the old and new data formats

! 2004-12-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Creation of CaloFillRawBuffer from CaloZSup in CaloDigit package, to code 
   Ecal and Hcal data and trigger banks, from CaloDigits and L0CaloAdcs.
 - Creation of CaloFillPrsSpdRawBuffer to code the Prs data and the Prs+Spd
   trigger banks, from CaloDigits (Prs) and L0PrsSpdHits (Prs and Spd).
