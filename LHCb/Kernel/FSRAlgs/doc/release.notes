   . DumpFSR, PropagateFSR, LumiMergeFSR, EventAccounting and the FSRNavigator
 - Removal of tests which should stay in Rec/LumiAlgs 
 - Removal of python modules which should stay in Rec/LumiAlgs
 - Creation of includes directory for interfaces
 - move test directory

 - Tested in Brunel with the new Rec/LumiAlgs, and all works fine.
