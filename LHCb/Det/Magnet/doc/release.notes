!======================== Magnet v1r1 update 2002-05-31 ======================
! 2002-05-31 - Edgar De Oliveira
 - Fix a Bug pointed by Rutger Hierck: When position y was set to zero
   the service was returning zero for By component of the field, what is not 
	 true.

 - Some float were changed to double and the internal function fieldGrid
   now returns void instead of a StatusCode that was not tested in any 
   circunstance. 

!======================== Magnet v1r0 release 2002-05-23 =====================
! 2002-05-23 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix a bug : When x>0, Y<0, the Y component of the field was inverted instead
   of the x component !
 - Added also a protection: Return a zero field when outside the field map.

! 2002-05-21 - Edgar De Oliveira
 - New version of MagneticFieldSvc (originally in SicbCnv).
   This version does not make use anymore of SICB utilities.
   The fortran interpolation of the grid has been replaced by a C++ 
   translation of the code.
   This version has as property the name of the field map file
   (property "FieldMapFile"). The default name of the field map will be
   $LHCBDASE/cdf/field043.cdf (if LHCBDBASE is defined) or field043.cdf
   in the local directory.
   The file is read in the initialize method of the service.
