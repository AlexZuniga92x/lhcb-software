! Package     : OTDet
! Responsible : J. van Tilburg

! 2002-11-12 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Add inefficiency around y=0. Halfway each long module are wire
   terminators which are inefficient. Since the modules are divided into
   a top and bottom part, the A layer (of the staggered double layer) is
   inefficient in the last 45 mm of the bottom part and the B layer in the
   last 45 mm of the top part.

!========================= OTDet v3r1 2002-11-11 ===========================
! 2002-11-11 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Add channelID iterator functions to DeOTDetector class.

!========================= OTDet v3r0 2002-10-17 ===========================
! 2002-10-14 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Add member functions to DeOTDetector (a.o.):
     o double resolution()
     o double propagationTime(OTChannelID, x, y)  
     o double driftTime(driftDist) = r-t relation
     o double driftDistance(driftTime) = inverse r-t relation
   These functions will allow that hard-coded parameters are not needed 
   anymore.
 - Add function to OTLayer:
     o double distanceToWire(OTChannelID, HepPoint3D, double tx, double ty)
   This calculates the distance to a wire given a point in space plus slopes.

!========================== OTDet v2r2 2002-10-04 ==========================
! 2002-08-07 Jeroen van Tilburg
  - Adjust OTLayer and DeOTDetector to C++ coding conventions.
  - Add descriptions.

!========================= OTDet v2r1 2002-07-25 =========================
! 2002-07-25 - M. Needham
  - Move a log statement to save at least 30 ms per event

!========================= OTDet v2r0 2002-07-09 =========================
! 2002-06-07 - Marco Cattaneo
  - Change version to v2r0

! 2002-06-06 Jeroen van Tilburg
  - OTLayer: added methods to check in which monolayer a straw is located 
    and methods to check if module is in top/bottom area.
    Removed obsolete 'get' methods.
  - DeOTDetector: renamed method from numStation() to numStations(). 
    Added method which returns the number of the first station with 
    OT technology.

!========================= OTDet v1r1 2002-05-27 =========================
! 2002-05-27 - Olivier Callot
 - Make private the methods of OTLayer which are not used by OTAlgorithms or
   FwTrack or TrFitEvent. 
 - Method names changed to agree with LHCb conventions, this means remove 
   the 'get' prefix.

! 2002-05-27 J. van Tilburg
  This is a new package for the Outer Tracker XML description.
  It is the replacement for the OTSicbGeom package. Now it works only 
  for the OT digitization.
   - DeOTDetector:     DetectorElement class that reads in the XmlDDDB.
   - OTLayer:          Copied exactly from OTSicbGeom/OTDetectionLayer.
   - XmlOTDetectorCnv: Needed to read in xml.
