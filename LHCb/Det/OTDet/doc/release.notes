 - Make private the methods of OTLayer which are not used by OTAlgorithms or
   FwTrack or TrFitEvent. 
 - Method names changed to agree with LHCb conventions, this means remove 
   the 'get' prefix.

  This is a new package for the Outer Tracker XML description.
  It is the replacement for the OTSicbGeom package. Now it works only 
  for the OT digitization.
   - DeOTDetector:     DetectorElement class that reads in the XmlDDDB.
   - OTLayer:          Copied exactly from OTSicbGeom/OTDetectionLayer.
   - XmlOTDetectorCnv: Needed to read in xml.
