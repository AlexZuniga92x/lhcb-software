package VeloDet
package manager : Velo Group

!=============================================================================
! 22/01/2002 - Olivier Callot  v3r0
  - Added new members to DeVelo (.h,.cpp) : rOfStrip, phiOfStrip rPitch and 
    phiPitch to be able to implement the VeloClusterOnTrack with this geometry.
    Also adapted the requirements to GaudiSys v9

!=============================================================================
! 10/01/2002 - Olivier Callot
  - Added the PU Veto wafer, with new methods to get their number and position.
    This is not fully tested for the PU Veto, but doesn't affect the Velo

!=============================================================================
! 26/11/2001 - Olivier Callot
  - Modifiy the detector element to add pseudo-strips in Phi wafer, as the 
	  shape in SICBMC is still half a circle. These strips have number over 2048
    and are properly handled by the strip-to-position routine.

!=============================================================================
! 25/10/2001 - Olivier Callot
  - Add a DeVelo detector element, to answer questions abou the position to 
    strip conversion with the TDR Velo geometry.

! 20010711 - v2 Flr
  VeloDetectorElement.h - include IGeometryInfo.h from DetDesc/

! 20010205 - Bruce Hay, Pere Mato

- This is a new package for the Velo detector description.
