  Muon/MuonKernel v1 can be compiled in the standalone mode (without
  Gaudi legacy) by excluding MsgStream and alike with conditional
  compiling (-DMUONKERNEL_LOCAL). The requirements contain "standalone" 
  tag now. To compile a standalone version: >gmake tag=standalone . It might
  be necessary to rm *.make* before that if old make files were
  made for non-standalone compilation.

  Initial version of the package containing basic Muon system classes 
  to manage the Muon system entities bookkeeping.
