! Package     : Tf/TfKernel
! Responsible : Tracking 'A-Team' for the moment ... Then someone else.
! Purpose     : Core classes for the Tf framework

! 2007-08-25 - Kurt Rinnert
 - a little documentation
 - removed redundant zone member from VeloHit
 - removed functionality from VeloSensorHits that is now provide by the VELO
   detector element
 - adapted VELO hit constructors to the improved interface of the VELO
   detector element
 - the first update of geometry related caches in VELO hit managers is now
   triggered via the update manager service, avoiding double initialisation at
   job startup.

! 2007-08-21 - Chris Jones
 - Add CMT incantations to generate Reflex dictionary

! 2007-08-21 - Kurt Rinnert
 - made the number of zones in the VELO hit managers available to
   non-templated derived classes (avoids hardcoding in custom hit managers)
 - changed some member names in VELO hit managers to follow convention

! 2007-08-21 - Chris Jones
 - Minor bug fixes to the T and TT hit managers
  + Fix ambiguities in method names
  + OTRangeID -> ITRangeID 
 - Add test alg to exercise hit managers

! 2007-08-21 - Wouter Hulsbergen
 - fixed bug in OTHitCleaner::removeClusters
 - removed maps from OTHitCleaner::removeHotModules and STHitCleaner::removeHotBeetles to speed things up

! 2007-08-20 - Chris Jones
 - Add new methods to TStationHitManager that select hits using a generic
   selector object.

! 2007-08-19 - Chris Jones
 - Add new 'ID' objects for use in the various hit creator/manager 
   interfaces. Help to clarify the inter-relationships between the various
   interfaces and also introduces a little type safety.

! 2007-08-18 - Chris Jones
 - Update data managers so on-demand hit creation is now done, region by
   region, instead of simply doing the all hits at once.
 - Remove the OTStationHitManager and ITStationHitManager classes, as they are
   no longer needed with the above on-demand decoding.

! 2007-08-16 - Chris Jones
 - Update the data managers so "prepareHits" is called on demand. No longer
   neccessary for the users to call it themselves.

! 2007-08-13 - Chris Jones
 - First import from ATEAM CVS of TfData and TfTools packages. 
   Currently imported into a single package, TfKernel, that creates both
   linker and component libraries. Could be split later if deemed appropriate.
