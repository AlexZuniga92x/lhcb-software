!=================== SFCClient v1r1 2005-06-27 =============================
! 2005-06-22 - Benjamin Gaidioz
 - RTTC updates of the SFCClient library. Main change is that all parameters
   of the SFCClient library are read by the library from environment variables
   rather than parameters from the job option file or parameters in GaudiOnline.
   Later, we will move back the parameters to the SFCClient library registration
   call and environment variables will be read from GaudiOnline.

!=================== SFCClient v1r0 2005-05-13 =============================
  New Package.
