- Increase the recv socket buffer (bug, loosing frames with HLT),
- call mlockall with the hope it will decrease the processing time of
  the very first event,
- added timings fields in the messages, take timestamps at various
  places for RTTC purposes,
- changed the message for decision (just talk about "bytes" and do not
  care about the meaning of the bytes).

 - RTTC updates of the SFCClient library. Main change is that all parameters
   of the SFCClient library are read by the library from environment variables
   rather than parameters from the job option file or parameters in GaudiOnline.
   Later, we will move back the parameters to the SFCClient library registration
   call and environment variables will be read from GaudiOnline.

!=================== SFCClient v1r0 2005-05-13 =============================
  New Package.
