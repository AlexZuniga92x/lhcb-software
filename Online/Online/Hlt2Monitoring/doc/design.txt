- Top level:
  - Receive all histo data.
  - Keep track of runs received in last 10 minutes and only keep histos for those.
  - If missing info, request from a few (4) random subfarms with REQ "INFOZPLX", wait for "INCOMINGZ",
    if timeout, try others.
    - Receive info on SUB socket, wait for {"THATSALLFOLKS", subfarm} of all subfarms with timeout.
      If timeout, or we didn't get what we wanted, ask a few others.
  - Keep track of runs received in last 10 minutes and only keep keys and histos for those,

- Subfarm level
  - Relay all histo data.
  - Keep track of runs received and requested in last 10 minutes and only keep keys and histos for those.
  - Listen to request {"INFOZPLX", node name, run, run, 0, key, key, key, 0, "KKTHXBAI"} answer with "INCOMINGZ",
    - Then connect to SUB service of node with PUB socket and send all infos of requested runs corresponding to
      keys they don't have, end with {"THATSALLFOLKS", subfarm}.
    - If there are some keys we don't have, ask all our node adders for their infos for given runs
  - Every so often (1 minute?), ask four random other subfarms for their infos using the method described above.

- Node level
  - Keep track of runs received and requested in last 10 minutes and only keep keys for those.
  - Strip task name from histo chunks, but save {key : taskname} to allow info from top level to be sent
  - If we don't have info for a key, ask for it from the corresponding
  - Listen to signal of tasks that they are finalizing. Clear info for those.

- Task level
  - Send task name with key and histo id for every chunk.
  - Send signal to node level adder when we are finalized to indicate that we are about to loose info.
  - Listen to request for info in the form of {key}, reply with {known, info} for that key.
