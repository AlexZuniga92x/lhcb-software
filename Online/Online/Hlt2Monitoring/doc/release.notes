 - Add python package to contain configuration module.
 - Catch errors from connection and bind attempts in Hlt2MonRelaySvc. This
   should also be done for the others.
 - Add a capture thread to Hlt2MonRelaySvc, which dumps the first part of every
   message as string. It is only enabled when the output level of the service
   is less than debug.
 - Fix saving:
   - Create new temporary file.
   - Close and remove old file and copy temporary file to old file
   - remove temporary file.

 - Add design document for next step.
 - Strings on the wire should not be null terminated.
 - Add Hlt2RootPublishSvc that converts the custom format histograms to TH1D.
   These are then picked up by the Hlt2SaverSvc and saved to files.
 - Hlt2MonBaseSvc
   - Implement methods for sending and receiving PODs and standard objects;
     strings and (run number, histo id).
 - Hlt2SaverSvc
   - Implement normalization of rate histos in the Hlt2SaverSvc. The histogram
     to normalize to is configurable through a property.
  - Use boost::multi_index_container.
 - Hlt2MonInfoSvc
   - Add a new type of info: RunInfo. For now it only contains the lumi
     parameters needed for normalization of the lumi rate histogram.
   - Remove relay functionality, this can be done by Hlt2MonRelaySvc
 - Hlt2AdderSvc
   - Configure connections from ports if both connection strings are empty.
