! Responsible : Roel Aaij
! Purpose     : Online monitoring of Hlt2
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2015-11-05 - Roel Aaij
 - Make configuration script a bit more configurable and add test script.

!========================= Hlt2Monitoring v1r5 2015-11-14 =========================

! 2015-11-05 - Roel Aaij
 - Adapt to changes in Online/ZeroMQ.

! 2015-11-05 - Roel Aaij
 - Move TCK out of Chunk and Histogram into RunInfo. Obtain TCK from condition
   if possible, otherwise from DecReports (only works when running from TCK),
   and otherwise set it to 0.

! 2015-10-08 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix bug in Hlt2RootPublishSvc introduced with the previous commit. The
   proper bin in the ROOT histograms is now properly calculated.

! 2015-10-07 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix bug in Hlt2RootPublishSvc: the bin size of the created histograms was
   not properly taken into accout. For the future the bin size of the incoming
   data should be part of the info message.

! 2015-09-08 - Roel Aaij
 - Store histogram type (i.e. RATE, HISTO1D) information in a
   map<string, string> in the SaveSet file.

! 2015-08-18 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix build with CMT.

! 2015-08-17 - Roel Aaij
 - Remove unneeded dependency on OnlineKernel.

! 2015-07-29 - Roel Aaij
 - Add Hlt2HistPublishSvc to publish histograms to the MonitorSvc.
 - Make loadSavedHistograms a free function so it can be used by the SaverSvc
   and the HistPublishSvc.
 - Add configuration for the Hlt2HistPublishSvc.

!========================= Hlt2Monitoring v1r1 2015-07-28 ====================

! 2015-07-27 - Roel Aaij
 - Use ipc for relay control connections.
 - Prepare for the appearance of hlt02.

! 2015-07-24 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix CMT build.

! 2015-07-23 - Roel Aaij
 - Updated design.txt with an idea on how to improve state transitions.
 - Disable pausing of processing threads to allow late messages to be received
   and processed.
 - Fix capturing in Hlt2MonRelaySvc.
 - The Hlt2MonBaseSvc contructor takes a optional third argument to select
   binding or connecting of the control socket so messages can be sent from
   multiple sources. This is used in the SaverSvc to allow regular saving
   without reception of messages. This should be done in all services. The
   control socket is connected in the base class by default.
 - Add an explicit Capture property to Hlt2MonRelaySvc.
 - Configure the output levels of services such that the debug output of the
   SaverSvc is visible on hlt01.
 - Add a little hack to the configuration script to allow configuration from
   python for a tasks that don't run on the farm nodes.

! 2015-07-22 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix lastUpdate time for newly received histograms.
 - Remove debug stuff from options.

! 2015-07-21 - Roel Aaij
 - Update Histogram class with constructors and assignment operators.
 - Add run start time to RunInfo.
 - Remove left-over messages when services start.
 - Fix Hlt2AdderSvc (boost::unordered_map::emplace seems to be a bad idea...)
 - Bind control socket in main thread, connect from other places.
 - Hlt2SavesSvc
   - Fix saving of histograms; create separate temporary file and replace
     original with temporary.
   - Put trigger for saving into separate thread.
   - Remove histograms from memory that have not been updated during the last
     2 save intervals.

! 2015-07-16 - Roel Aaij
 - Add python package to contain configuration module.
 - Catch errors from connection and bind attempts in Hlt2MonRelaySvc. This
   should also be done for the others.
 - Add a capture thread to Hlt2MonRelaySvc, which dumps the first part of every
   message as string. It is only enabled when the output level of the service
   is less than debug.
 - Fix saving:
   - Create new unique temporary file.
   - Close and remove old file and copy temporary file to old file
   - remove temporary file.

! 2015-07-15 - Roel Aaij
 - Add design document for next step.
 - Strings on the wire should not be null terminated.
 - Add Hlt2RootPublishSvc that converts the custom format histograms to TH1D.
   These are then picked up by the Hlt2SaverSvc and saved to files.
 - Hlt2MonBaseSvc
   - Implement methods for sending and receiving PODs and standard objects;
     strings and (run number, histo id).
 - Hlt2SaverSvc
   - Implement normalization of rate histos in the Hlt2SaverSvc. The histogram
     to normalize to is configurable through a property.
  - Use boost::multi_index_container.
 - Hlt2MonInfoSvc
   - Add a new type of info: RunInfo. For now it only contains the lumi
     parameters needed for normalization of the lumi rate histogram.
   - Remove relay functionality, this can be done by Hlt2MonRelaySvc
 - Hlt2AdderSvc
   - Configure connections from ports if both connection strings are empty.

!========================= Hlt2Monitoring v1r0 2015-06-29 ====================

! 2015-06-24 - Roel Aaij
 - Use a base class for all services.
 - Add initial SaverSvc.
 - Add MonInfoSvc.

! 2015-06-19 - Roel Aaij
 - Switch to per-bin differences in Chunk.

! 2015-06-17 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix binding of backend connection of Hlt2MonRelaySvc.
 - Add first implementation of Adder, it just prints histograms to cout.

! 2015-06-11 - Roel Aaij
 - Updates to Hlt2MonRelaySvc, works in a small test now.

! 2015-06-10 - Roel Aaij
 - Initial import
