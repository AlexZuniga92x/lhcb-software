! 10-05-2005 Markus Frank
  Adapt to LHCb v18r4 and the use of RawEvent/L1Event instead of
  RawBuffer and L1Buffer

 There are a few examples coming along with this package.
 1) options/RawBufferWriter: Write binary raw buffer file from POOL dst
 2) options/RawBufferSender: Send RawBuffer object using IP connection
    to analysis process
 3) options/RawBufferReader: Reads RawBuffer objects from process
    RawBufferSender (which must be started before). Skeleton analysis process.
    Note: Examples need environment SFCCONNECTION to be set properly.

  New Package.
