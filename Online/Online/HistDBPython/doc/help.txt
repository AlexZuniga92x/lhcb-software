============= example of python scripts to interface the Histogram DB
============= written and mantained by Nicola Chiapolini
============= created December 2008

** Installation
1. Add OnlineHistDB to your requirement file
2. Copy the example files into your working directory and
   adjust them as needed.
3. create a password file:
   - the file should only contain the password for the 
     HIST_WRITER user of the OnlineHistDB and is best
     placed in the same directory as the option files.
   - File name and location can be specified by the 
     PasswordFile option in the option file.
   - Default filename is 'password'


** Organisation:

*) Page definitions:
To define a page, the following files need to exist:
- page.py
  defines the pages in the folder tree that are set up
  according to this configuration as well as the page
  configuration itself (i.e. the histograms to be displayed)
- layout.py
  defines the layout used for the page 
  [gets included in page.py]
- genCreate.py
  adds the algorithm to the application manager, and sets
  other general options of the CreateHistDBPages algorithm.
  [gets included in page.py]

*) Display options:
To set displayoptions, the following files need to exist:
- dopts.py
  defines the histograms as well as the options that should be set.
- genSet.py 
  adds the algorithm to the application manager, and sets other 
  general options of the SetHistDisplayOptions algorithm.
  [gets included in dopts.py]


for more info see the comments in the example files 
(names as above with prefix "example_")


** running

a) individual page
$ gaudirun.py page.py
Hint: *) using "gaudirun.py -vn ..." does just parse 
          the files without execution

b) several pages
$ .runCreatePages.sh page1 page2 page3 ...
