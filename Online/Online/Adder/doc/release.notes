This program adds 1D, 2D histograms published by tasks using the Gaucho
MonitorSvc and publishes them.

The adder program should be started only when the programs producing the histograms
that should be added are already running; for the hierarchy of adders, the lower
level ones should be started before the higher level ones. This is because the
DimBrowser (who determines the exact name of the Dim histogram services names
that the adder should subscribe to) is only run once, at the beginning of the
job.

The adder adds histograms produced by identical tasks on a node or a set of nodes. The histogram DIM
service names have to be of the following format (n=histogram dimension):

  HnD/UTGID/Algorithmname/Histogramname
  
Use of the MonitorSvc guarantees that this format is used. The UTGID normally has the
following format:

  node00101_taskname_1
  
"node" is the convention for nodes on the EFF. The first three digits (001) indicate
the subfarmnumber, and the fourth and fifth digits (01) indicate the nodenumber inside
the subfarm. For the adder, the taskname is "Adder". The last digit is the instance
number of the task.  

For example, a Moore task publishing a histogram with name "Mass" will create a DIM service with
name:

   H1D/node00101_Moore_1/Algorithmname/Mass
   
The added "Algorithmname/Mass" histogram will be published in a DIM service with name (provided the UTGID
environment variable is set to "node00101_Adder_1"):

   H1D/node00101_Adder_1/Adder/Algorithmname/Mass   

To add the summed histograms of a subfarm, the UTGID should be set to node001_Adder_1. The name of the
DIM service containing the sum of the sums is set to 

   H1D/node001_Adder_1/Adder/Algorithmname/Mass
   
One can continue adding the sums at the level of the entire farm in a similar way:

   H1D/node_Adder_1/Adder/Algorithmname/Mass

The configuration is done via joboptions:

- nodename  : This is a string containing the name of the node where the tasks
producing the histograms that have to be added are running. It is important that
this string is part of the UTGID environment variable that is set when the tasks
are running. For example, node00101. If the adder is supposed to add the summed histograms of
tasks on the nodes running in a subfarm, e.g. subfarm001, the nodename joboption should be set to
"node001" (and the UTGID to node001_Adder_1). To add the sums of subfarms, set the nodename 
to "node" (and the UTGID to node_Adder_1).

- histogramname : This is a vector of strings containing the names of the
histograms that have to be added. Constraint: if a name is already used for a 1D histogram,
it can not be used for a 2D histogram and vice versa.


- algorithmname : This is a vector of strings containing the names of the
corresponding algorithms of the histograms that have to be saved (there must be
as many algorithms as there are histograms).

- refreshtime : This is the time interval with which the sums are
calculated.

- dimclientdns : This is the DIM_DNS_NODE used by the tasks producing the histograms.
If it is not set, the DIM_DNS_NODE is taken from the environment variable (the default). 
The summed histograms published by the adder use the DIM_DNS_NODE defined by the
environment variable.

The script cmt/startadder.csh can be used to start the adder (in the lxplus environment).
