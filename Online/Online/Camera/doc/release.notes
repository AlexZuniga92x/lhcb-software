 - Updated the requirements file to use "" around the dependencies in the
   dependency macro. This fixes the make -j problem and it builds successfully.
 - Added install_python_modules so configurables are built.

! 2009-02-03 - Gareth Rogers
 - Updated the CameraTool.h to document the functions. CameraTool.cpp had the
   Enabled feature more comprehensively implemented such that a disabled tool
   will do the minimum possible.
 - Configurable has been updated to accept an empty string for the ServerName
   slot, which will automatically disable the CameraTool. If a ServerName is
   passed the tool will be enabled.

! 2009-02-02 - Gareth Rogers
