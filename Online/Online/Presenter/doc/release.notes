!============ Presenter v0r23 2010-01-21 =============
2010-01-21 G.Graziani
some fixes 
+ recover loading of pages with multiple virtual histograms
+ fits are now correctly redone on every refresh, avoid parallel histogram refresh for pages containing fits
  (ROOT fitting not thread-safe)
+ history mode: show sources in statusbar
+ if saveset on command line, load it at startup (no more need to select "preset file")
+ re-establish automatic DB connection at startup
+ update source list in requirements

!============ Presenter v0r22 2009-11-13 =============
2009-11-13
+ reshuffle pages in folders via DND in left panel
  note: ROOT DND often crashes when hovering mouse
  while Highlight. (HandleEvent in GUI is "too
  complicated and unmaintainable"[sic])
+ create folders
+ rename pages
+ new saveset structure

!============ Presenter v0r21 2009-09-14 =============
2009-09-14
+ create trendplots from MonRates in batch
+ added trendplots in GUI, Database (please don't load
  pages from DB in Editor mode just yet)
+ added TCK awareness when trendplot is present on page

!============ Presenter v0r20 2009-06-16 =============
2009-06-16
+ create entry to logbook
+ test // loading of histograms
+ new config file, DB login mechanism has changed!
  automatic login attempt using first DB entries
+ View->Hide Alarm list, also from cfg file
o hopefully fixed history mode file browser issues

!============ Presenter v0r19 2009-06-01 =============
2009-06-01
+ print/save page as eps, pdf, png etc.
+ back/forth navigation of hyperlinks/pages

!============ Presenter v0r17 2009-04-14 =============
! 2009-04-14
+ initial Brunel and DaVinci file support
0 feedback from fest2
+ Giacomo's patch: new DB entries (e.g. PadMargins)
    fix ref. normalization
+ double click on histos link to another page
+ msg list handling: display histos in alarm

!============ Presenter v0r16 2009-03-05 =============
! 2009-03-05
0 fix histo zoom

!============ Presenter v0r15 2009-02-01 =============
! 2009-02-01
0 drop MonH1F and MonH2F support
+ custom artwork overlay in standard plot mode
+ fixed histogram selection
+ preliminary offline editor mode using file as
  histogram svc
+ partition support for EFF
+ render 2D histos with doubles as images in fast mode
+ establish partitions using fs entries at init,
  instead of DIM browsing (faster startup)

!============ Presenter v0r14 2008-11-24 =============
! 2008-11-24
+ page comments and histogram descriptions
+ ignore histos from dead tasks on a page
+ trend plot of savesets

!============ Presenter v0r13 2008-11-04 =============
! 2008-11-04
+ save histogram description to DB
+ new saveset & ref. paths
+ history mode partition,
+ red refs, statopts global setting
! disabling of virtual analysis histo references
+ initial EFF Adder DIM address support 
+ DIM cached in DB, seeking only when broken
+ Giacomo's "trend" aggregation

!============ Presenter v0r12 2008-09-26 =============
! 2008-09-16
+ fix MonObject Clear&Restore
+ support missing partition names from UTGID
+ attempt to remove dead-body feature of ROOT
! 2008-09-26
+ from Giacomo: algorithm name for savesets, 
    ref. management moved to OMAlib

!============ Presenter v0r11 2008-09-01 =============
! 2008-09-01
+ MonObject support

!============ Presenter v0r10 2008-06-17 =============
! 2008-06-17
+ Quick partition selector with autodiscovery
+ Dynamic DIM service address for histograms
+ Navigation in History mode through time

!============ Presenter v0r9 2008-06-05 =============
! 2008-06-05
+ resume refresh when switching pages
+ filter DIM services remotely (~faster DIM tree refresh)

!============ Presenter v0r9 2008-05-23 =============
! 2008-05-23
o use ROOT "thermic" colour palette instead of custom
o default error bars when rendering profile histograms
+ history mode: can specify a root file at startup;
  there is also a rudmientary file picker for savesets.
  Pressing Cancel in TGFileDialog file picker invokes
  a crash as of now: please press "Ok" instead.
+ faster startup: reading DIM services to fill trees is
  done only in Editor mode
o reverted to "power" editor mode (can clear histos
  again)

!============ Presenter v0r8 2008-04-19 =============
! 2008-04-19
o recover from profile histogram rendering regression

!============ Presenter v0r7 2008-03-19 =============
! 2008-03-19
o Root-style multiple selection on trees
+ references can be saved in editor mode and be selected
  through the GUI (selection is one-by-one)
+ overlay display is steered by a reference button
  and the HistoDB entry 
- navigation panel in history mode does not work
o savesets and references need to be parametrized via
  command-line or config file (defaults in the pit
  don't work yet)

!============ Presenter v0r6 2008-01-30 =============
! 2008-01-30
 o based on Root 5.18.00 and Boost 1.34.1
 + modes of operation switchable between Online,
   History and Page Editor
 + new configuration: command-line and via file
 icon theme: GNOME Art "Gnome 2.18 icon theme By aneglus"

!============ Presenter v0r5 2007-11-29 =============
! 2007-11-29
 + updated to OnlineHistDB v4
 + new GUI layout
 + minor bugfixes, improvements
 + initial reference histogram support
   (no setting through GUI)

!============ Presenter v0r4 2007-10-29 =============
! 2007-10-29
 - New test package.
