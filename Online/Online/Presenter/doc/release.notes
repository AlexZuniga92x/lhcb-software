 - Add an optional Subject to Elog, for SD logbooks
 - Minor cleanup in the related code.

! 2010-02-01 - Olivier Callot
 - Make the ELOG button functional. You need to specify the Elog server host in the config file
   under entry 'logbook-settings'. When pressing the button, a windows pops up to specify
   the logbook name, user name, system and message text. The current displayed page is attached
   to the logbook entry.

! 2010-01-27 - Olivier Callot
 - Display the name of the page in the top status bar, aslo for alarms.
 - Prev/Next page navigate in a group, i.e. a directory of the database,
   or the list of alarms. The list wraps around, i.e. next of last is first.
