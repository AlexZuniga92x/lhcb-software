   *     to connect to.
   * 2.  Provide a preferred address to connect to in case a node has failed.
   *     In case the node is in "failed-over" mode, then monitor the failed
   *     node to see if it comes up, and connect to it when it does.
   * NOTE: The failover service need not necessarily always be connected
   * to the same server as the writer. The failover service does not interfere
   * with the writer service.
