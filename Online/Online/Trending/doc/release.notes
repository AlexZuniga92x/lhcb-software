! Package     : Online/Trending
! Responsible : Olivier Callot
! Purpose     : Provide tools for fast trending in C++
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!============================== 2011-08-05 v2r0 ==============================
! 2011-08-05 - Olivier Callot
 - Add the setAverageTime to the SimpleTrendWriter interface and tool

! 2011-08-01 - Olivier Callot
 - New functions in the interface to write average values
  * setAverageTime( unsigned int delta ) : set the interval time in second for average
  * addValue( std::string tag, float value ) : Store this value for this tag in average mode
  Note that the standard write ( std::vector<float>, unsigned int time ) works also in average 
  mode, i.e. all tags are averaged. This is to be used if you ha ve new values for all your tags.

! 2011-07-28 - Olivier Callot
 - Improve the dump tool
 - Zeroes the data buffer in the writer, to make debug easier...

! 2011-07-27 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix a bug in hadling multiple of 32 tags.
 - Fix a few compilation warning on Windows.

! 2011-07-22 - Olivier Callot
 - Rewrite seriously the tool: Use the small object TrendWriter in the tool
 - Change somewhatthe interface: 
      The time becomes an unsigned int.
      The version number as argument to the openWrite is removed. Version is automatic.
      Version number changed.

! 2011-06-10 - Olivier Callot
 - Remove the 'extern "C"' before the declaration of the main in the two applicattions

!============================== 2011-06-06 v1r8 ==============================
! 2011-06-06 - Olivier Callot
 - New program DumpTrendingFile to analyse a file and detect ordering problems,
   inconsistencies and large time gaps.
 - Fix the use of the same tool for write after read ( e.g. in SimpleToolWriter )
   Some variables needed re-initialization. Files were corrupted upon restart.

! 2011-05-31 - Olivier Callot
 - New program ExtractFromTrendingFile for Renaud: needs 4 arguments: file,
   tag, start and end time in ISO format.
   It outputs a list, one per lines, of time stamp (ISO format) and value.

! 2011-05-27 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix scan of first entry, if none in the time window.

!============================== 2011-04-07 v1r5 ==============================
! 2011-04-07 - Olivier Callot
 - New method of ITrendingTool needed for the presenter, for multi-version access.
 - Setting version=-1 in openWrite will use the next version number if neecded.
 - The first event/entry retrieved after a 'select' is teh value at the time of the
   startTime argument of the select.

! 2011-03-24 - Olivier Callot
 - New tool SimpleTrendWriter with interface ISimpleTrendWriter for simple
   writing, targetted for adders. 

! 2011-03-24 - Olivier Callot
 - New header file TrendWriter.h to be able to write from plain C++ code, without
   the use of a Gaudi Tool. Not nice for maintenance...
 - Rested the buffer pointers on file close, so that re-opening the file will re-
   read it.
 - If a threshold is negativem, it indicates a fraction of the previous value: 
   A threshold of -0.01 indicate that we should store if the value has changed by
   more than 1% compared to the previous stored value.

! 2010-09-08 - Markus Frank
 - Fix compile warning in TrendingTool.cpp

!============================== 2010-07-30 v1r1 ==============================
! 2010-07-23 - Olivier Callot
 - Initialize the directory buffer when reading the file

! 2010-06-15 - Olivier Callot
 - Protect against too big tag array, at 10% of buffer size.
 - Improve the runTest script to test the trending tool.

! 2010-06-14 - Olivier Callot
 - Add a missing #include <ctime> needed for Windows.

!============================== 2010-06-13 v1r0 ==============================
! 2010-06-10 - Olivier Callot
 - Initial release. This package provide a fast and efficient way to store a block
   of information versus time, with threshold for suppressing non-changing values,
   and to efficiently retrive it.
   Documentation is available in a dedicated note.
