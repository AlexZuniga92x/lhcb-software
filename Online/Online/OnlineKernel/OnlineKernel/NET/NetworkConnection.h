/**
    {\Large{\bf Class NetworkConnection}}
    Basic interface of ANY networking connection.

 This is a tricky: NetworkAddress should not be used
 as a variable type at all!
 Instead use the defined variable type of the specific
 connection class:
 e.g.   UdpConnection::Address  new_address;
 The wrapped address type contains the required structure
 and only this structure, i.e. the meory mapping and
 size is identical.
