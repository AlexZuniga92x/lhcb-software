  /// Class describing a MBM Consumer 
  /** 
   *   Every readout function is separated into independent tasks running 
   *   asynchronously in order to derandomize the flow of events. The producer 
   *   task is responsible for reading/assembling data from data sources. 
   *
   *   As soon as the read operation is finished, the data block is declared 
   *   to a managed shared memory area, the buffer manager (BM) and the 
   *   producer is ready for the next read operation.
   *
   *   The consumer task is activated each time an event is declared in the BM. 
   *   The consumer is responsible for releasing the space occupied as 
   *   soon as the consumer has finished processing. Thus, the two activities 
   *   of reading and processing can proceed asynchronously, provided there is 
   *   always sufficient space in the buffer to accommodate at least one read 
   *   operation. 
   *
   *   A BM is managed by a dedicated task executing on each node, which creates 
   *   and initializes the shared memory area. The synchronization between the 
   *   various participating processes has been realized using shared semaphores. 
   *   Any task using the BM registers itself with a name and a partition identifier.
   *   Consumers will only receive data declared by producers with the same 
   *   partition identifier and a boolean accept and veto mask of a width of 128 bits, 
   *   which allows consumers to be specific in the type of data they wish to 
   *   receive. Consumers may request data from the BM in three different ways:
   *   \li The consumer sees all data declared to the BM according to the request mask.
   *   \li A group of consumers see the data exactly once. This mode allows 
   *       executing multiple instances of an application and taking advantage 
   *       of multiple CPU cores.
   *   \li A consumer is served on a best effort basis. In this mode producers 
   *       are always able to declare new data. Possibly pending data, which 
   *       have to be released to satisfy the space requests, are not seen by 
   *       these consumers.
