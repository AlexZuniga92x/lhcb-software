Requirements:
   - DIM. The package has been developed using the v16rXX and v17rXX DIM versions. It has not been tested with older versions but I believe it has good chances to work.
   - The package has been developed on 32 and 64 bits arhitectures.

How to run:
   - set up the environment and make sure the DIM_DNS_NODE variable is set
   - execute tests from the PyDIM/tests directory. These can be used as starting examples for development
