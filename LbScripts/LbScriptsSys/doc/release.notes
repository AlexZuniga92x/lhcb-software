2011-10-18  Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@cern.ch>

	* cmt/requirements: release of version v6r5

	LbConfiguration:
	* python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py:
	- forces the usage of the usage of the LCG python if a specific version
	  of python is requested.
	- python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py: added the "-w" option in order to do partial selection of the CMTCONFIG. For
	  example "LbLogin -w i686" will select the best i686 CMTCONFIG for the platform. The order of selection is
	  defined in LbConfiguration.Platform (EXPERIMENTAL).
	* python/LbConfiguration/SetupProject.py (Marco Cl.):
	- fixed bug #86875 Added the possibility to pretend we are on CVMFS via an environment
	  variable (SP_FAKE_CVMFS).
	- removed DIRAC/LHCbDIRAC hacks
	* python/LbConfiguration/Package.py: 
	- added Det/STSQLDDDB in the list of supported packages.
	- added SVN fallback to getPackage.
	- added security check when retrieving packages from SVN. It checks that
	  the containing project is in the supported ones list.
	- added flag to prevent exception raising.
	- filterout external projects for SVN searching
	* python/LbConfiguration/Project.py: 
	- added fallback on SVN for getProject function.

	LbLegacy:
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py:
	- factored out the fallback post install script for LbScripts
        - factored out the post manipulation of data packages.
	- added hook for post installation of LbScripts
	- wrapped os.system call to rather use the subprocess module when possible.
	- added environment passing to systemCall
	- added infrastructure in order to call an update script each time that that project
	  is listed in the dependencies.
	- implemented -t option to pass custom temporary base directory. It is then randomly seeded.
	  Please note that the safest is to used the canonical system one. ie: "-t $TMPDIR" or "-t /tmp"
	- added post install action for data packages. Now it also tries to look for PostInstall.py in <packgage>/<ver>/cmt
	- registered an "atexit" function in order to do a final removal of the temporary directory if mdtemp was used.
	- use the SVN fallback for the project configuration.
	- implement cache for project and package configuration. This
	  prevent too many useless connection to SVN if the package/project is not known. To be
	  noted that a proper abstraction of the configuration from both package and projects would
	  be better.
	- fixed the safeMove function that treats correctly links (at the first level) that are moved
	  across filesystems.
	- added safeMakeDirs that removes correctly broken links on the target directory.
	- replaced plain mkdirs with safeMakeDirs that first remove broken links if it exists.
	- factored out the md5 extraction to extractMD5SumFromFile
	- use the new getPackage version (with SVN fallback) instead of the plain package_names for the
	  datapackage identification.
	- generalised getMD5FileName. Now it also works with html files.
	* scripts/mkMCGentar: global fix for generator comming from a different location than the
	regular MCGenerators directory.
	* scripts/mkLCGCMTtar: converted binary type for gcc. This one exposes the host tag for its binary version
	and we need to use the target tag when building the tarballs.
	* scripts/mkLHCbtar: added calculation of the MD5 sum for the distribution.htm file.

	LbRelease:
	* Major clean up of Pydev Code Analysis warnings
	* python/LbRelease/GetPack.py: factored out utilities placed in LbUtils.VCS.

	* LbUtils/python/LbUtils/Thread.py: clean up of Pydev Code Analysis warnings.
	* python/LbUtils/File.py: added move function that treats correctly top level links.
	* python/LbUtils/VCS.py: New file. collected various utilities from LbConfiguration.Repository
	and LbRelease.rcs.
	* python/LbUtils/Path.py: added function to remove entries from a given os.pathsep separated path.

	LbScriptsSys:
	* added cmt/PostInstall.py script for the generation and installation of the 
	login scripts.


2011-10-17  Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@cern.ch>

	* python/LbConfiguration/SetupProject.py: fixed pyLint errors.
	* python/LbConfiguration/Project.py: added proper XML encoding (UTF-8).

	of floats contained in /proc/loadavg.
	* python/LbUtils/Processes.py: added the "report_failure" option to the callCommand function. It is is
	True, the stdout and stderr of the failure are reported to to the logger. This only happens if the
	return code of the command is different from 0.

	LbConfiguration:
	* python/LbConfiguration/SetupProject.py: added debug printout for
	the stripping of PATHs (Marco Cl.)
	* python/LbConfiguration/Platform.py:

	then it goes unmolested. If it is a broken link or a file, it is renamed with the "_bak" extension
	and a directory is created.


	LbLegacy
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py:
	- implemented function to fix the $CMTROOT/mgr/setup.{sh,csh}. In these files the CMTROOT
	is always reset. Now they doesn't try to set it if it is already present in the environment.

	- copy itself to the first entry of $MYSITEROOT if it is not already there.
	- passed debug flag to generateLogin if debug_flag is True.
	- fixed problem with generateLogin if the MYSITEROOT directory has somewhere a link in its path.
	- fixed the comparison of the lhcb subdirectory with os.getcwd() by using os.path.abspath. Because
	this is what os.getcwd() is returning anyway.
	- added clone of cleanPath (LbUtils.Path) in order to clean up the initial MYSITEROOT and VO_LHCB_SW_DIR.
	Please note that the path is not normalized (os.path.normpath) because it could lead to inconsistencies
	if there are ".." and links.
	- fixed unTarFile function. Now an output_path parameter can be passed to the function.
	- fixed removal of the .html file in overwrite mode.
	- fixed copy of existing install_project.py into .old. This was breaking when installing
	remotely (not in the current directory) and when a self update was performed.
	- added checks for VO_LHCB_SW_DIR. If MYSITEROOT has only one entry, an attempt is made to correct
	the value of that variable. It will succeed only if $MYSTEROOT==$VO_LHCB_SW_DIR/lib.
	- added the version of LbScripts in the banner in debug mode.
	* scripts/mkLHCbtar:
	- fixed osc_vis dependency extraction. Removed obsolete CVS update for the Gaudi project.
	- fixed usage of the TempDir class.
	* scripts/mkproject:
	- moved the fixLinks function. Now it only applies when locking (-a K) or when creating tarballs.
	- fixed problem with the --not-parallel option. It was alway active because of the -p option.
	* scripts/mkLCGCMTtar: fixed typo when calling the CMT

	LbRelease:
	* python/LbRelease/CMT/LbProject.py:
	fixed usage of the User release area in LbCMTWhich.
	- renamed lbcmtwhich into lbwhich.
	- added a switch to exclude the user_release_area.
	- implemented the lbwhich command: This command locates the package used by the project.
	The version is the one of the project if it is a regular project and it is the one of
	the package for versionless projects like DBASE.
	syntax: lbwhich Project Package version
	       lbwhich Project version
               lbwhich Project Package
               lbwhich Project

	for summary generation taken from svn.cern.ch (https) instead of svnweb (http); project
	list sorted in the "Display criteria"; link to SVN modified to point to configuration
	file (Karol)

	* python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py: added support for new component in the CMTPROJECTPATH:
	  $MYSITEROOT/lcg/app/releases. It will be added only if the directory exists.
	* python/LbConfiguration/Package.py: added ChargedProtoANNPIDParam to the list of PARAM packages.
	* python/LbConfiguration/Version.py: added generic version sorting. This relies on the splitting of
	  the string holding the version into alphabetic and numeric token which then are placed in a tuple. This
	  works for any version type (LHCb, LCG, ROOT) except for the extended LHCb version with the "-pre" suffix.
	* python/LbConfiguration/Platform.py: added support for win64 and vc9.
	* scripts/generateLogin: fixed the test for the login shell in the main wrapper.

	  repositories containing the package/project.
	* scripts/move_package: added skeleton of the script
	* python/LbRelease/rcs.py: factored out the callCommand and RetryCommand utilities to the
	  LbUtils.Processes module.
	* python/LbRelease/LHCbNightlies.py: client must be started with CMTCONFIG as a parameter,
	  and now it can build only platforms that have not only the same platform type (slc4/sl5)
	  but also matching architecture (32b/64b) (already in production) (Karol)

	* data/Makefile: removed the export of CCACHE_PREFIX, which doesn't seem to be needed and causes problems
	  if distcc is not used when using ccache. (Marco Cl.)
	* python/LbUtils/Log.py: added NullHandler to be used in libraries. This is usefull when the
	  main application calling the library is not defining any logger.
	* python/LbUtils/Processes.py: factored out the callCommand and RetryCommand utilities from the
	  LbRelease.rcs module.
	* python/LbUtils/Terminal.py: new file. Added the function to get the size of the terminal. It
	  works both on Linux and windows.
	* python/LbUtils/afs/directory.py: added a check when removing ACL. The new ACL settings is cleaned of
	  groups with empty ACL
	* python/LbUtils/Path.py: added check for existence in the path manipulation functions.
	* data/Makefile: avoid removing the whole InstallArea on 'clean' (just InstallArea/$CMTCONFIG)

	ones.
	* python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py: added the "--dev" option. It allows to use the LHCBDEV area for

	from one to the other), use a custom layout and a custom stylesheet. (Marco Cl.)
	* python/LbRelease/_LHCbDocResources.py: (new) module used internally by LHCbDoc
	for the files needed in the Doxygen configuration. (Marco Cl.)
	* scripts/lhcb_bkk: add -f options for csh (Joel)

	* scripts/mkLCGCMTtar: added the generation of the html file for LCGCMT like tarballs
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py:
	- fix for "-C" option (lists compatible CMTCONFIG). It doesn't require any arguments
	  any more on the command line.
	- allows the listing of LCGCMT like tarballs
	- fixed the binary of LCGCMT like tarballs: it is always optimized.
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py: get now the html dependencies recursively.
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py: fixed dependency bug when using --check. The html dependency
	file is only present for the explicitly installed project. For the intermediate ones installed as
