# Trying to compile an old .fvwrc to the  new fvwm-2.0 Format
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                Group Menu - FVWM Configuration File
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# CONTENTS:
#   This file contains the template for the user root menu for FVWM.
#
# ACTIVATION:
#   The menu defined in this file will be popped up when the user push the
#   right-most button of the mouse (button 3) over the root window.
#
# USAGE:
#   This file must be located in the ~/.hepix/fvwm directory with the name
#   `fvwm_menu'. Initially this file is initialized with the same entries 
#   as the System Menu attached to the left-most button of the mouse (button 
#   1).
#   
#
# SYNTAX:
#   The contents must be enclosed between `Popup "UserMenu"' and `EndPopup'
#   Each line becomes an entry in the menu. The most important types of 
#   entries are the following:
#
#     o Title "<string>"
#       <string> becomes the title (first entry) in the menu.
#
#     o Exec "<string>" exec <command>
#       <string> becomes and entry that executes the command <command>.
#
#     o Popup "<popup_name>"
#       This entry will create a sub-menu entry. The sub-menu should be 
#       created with a Popup command in the same way as this "UserMenu" is
#       created. This sub-menu can be created in this file before the 
#       UserMenu. 
#
#     o Nop ""
#       Creates a divisory line.
#
#   There are more types of entries described in the the BUILT IN FUNCTIONS
#   section of the fvwm(n) manual page (issue the command "gman fvwm").
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   This file will be merged with other FVWM configuration files to generate
#   the definite FVWM configuration file upon entering your X session.
#   
# REFERENCES:
#   See the section BUILT IN FUNCTIONS in the fvwm(n) manual page to get 
#   further details about menu items.
