! Package     : Rec/ChargedProtoANNPID
! Responsible : Chris Jones
! Purpose     : Charged ProtoParticle ANN PID
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2013-05-30 - Chris Jones
 - Add a specific ANNPID tuning for 2013 data, using "MC12TuneV2".

! 2013-05-09 - Chris Jones
 - Add a short info() level summary printout to ChargedProtoANNPIDAlg, to help
   identify the configuration in use from a log file.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r1 2013-04-30 =======================
! 2012-04-26 - Chris Jones
 - Move the TMVA 'MC12TuneV2' compiled MVA namespace into the ANNGlobalPID
   namespace.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r0 2013-04-23 =======================

! 2013-04-17 - Marco Clemencic
 - Ported to CMake the configuration to disable the use of Neurobayes.

! 2013-04-16 - Chris Jones
 - Update the CMT requirements file to only enable Neurobayes on platforms
   that it supports (CMake to follow).
 - Small update to the python configurable for use in the 'on-demand'
   recalibration of the ANNPID in DaVinci.

! 2013-04-15 - Chris Jones
 - Rework the code to compute the input variables to the ANN PID networks,
   to remove the remaining CPU overheads.
 - Remove the use of a full track selector tool, as we are only using it to
   select the correct track type. More efficient to just do it directly.
 - No longer print a warning if the ANNPID is being replaced for a given
   ProtoParticle, as this is normal when applied as a recalibration.
   Also, saves a little more CPU due to the string manipulations that
   where required.

! 2013-04-12 - Chris Jones
 - Add new MC12TuneV2 network tuning :-
  . Based on high statistics training using new MC12 inclusive B samples.
  . Uses TMVA instead of Neurobayes as MVA technology.
   . Gives slightly PID better performance.
   . Much faster implementation due to use of compiled TMVA macros.
  . Config files have now been imported from the Paramfiles package
    ChargedProtoANNPIDParam directly into this package.
  . Dropped support for obsolete tunings (parameters not imported).
    Only MC12TuneV1 and MC12TuneV2 now supported.

! 2013-04-09 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add __init__.py to please CMake

! 2013-04-02 - Chris Jones
 - Add 'FromB' and 'FromD' flags to training tuple.
 - Update ganga scripts to v6 series.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r12 2013-03-22 =========================
! 2013-03-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation with CMake.

! 2013-03-17 - Paul Szczypka
 - Added "Upgrade" key to NetworkVersions property. New key maps to "MC12TuneV1"
   which is the same as the "2012" key.

! 2013-03-13 - Chris Jones
 - Add a TMVAImpFactory to provide instances of compiled TMVA classifers for known
   configurations. Using compiled classes are roughly 3 times faster than using
	 the corresponding TMVA::Reader implementation with the XML weights file.
   If a compiled instance is not registered with the factory for a particular
   network configuration, the TMVA::Reader implementation is used as the fallback.
   Currently no C++ implementations are included. This will be added once training
   is complete.

! 2013-03-11 - Chris Jones
 - Remove rescaling of the TMVA output value. Not required if EstimatorType=CE
   is used (which looks promising in tests).

! 2013-03-09 - Chris Jones
 - Add support for TMVA based network tunings.
 - Update preselection cut handling to support the new style text file based
   specification the training application now uses.
 - Improve access to the RecSummary data object to prevent multiple loads from
   the TES each event.

! 2013-02-18 - Chris Jones
 - Print some basic statistics of the ANNPID distributions during finalize,
   to help monitor for instabilities in the expert.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r11 2013-02-14 ======================
! 2013-02-01 - Chris Jones
 - Make it possible to turn on or offline the suppression of printout from the
   underlying ANN library (NeuroBayes) via options.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r10 2013-01-30 =========================
! 2013-01-30 - Chris Jones
 - Turn off the forcible suppression of stdout and stderr printout from
   NeuroBayes, for testing.

! 2012-12-07 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Suppress variadic macros warning from neurobayes header file when compiling
   with gcc -pedantic

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r9 2012-11-28 =========================

 - Fixed -pedantic warnings.

! 2012-11-21 - Chris Jones
 - Add missing dependency on Event/MCEvent
 - Add back some 'event size' variables previously removed, as they are useful
   for monitoring, if nothing else.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r8 2012-08-16 =========================

! 2012-08-10 - Chris Jones

   preliminary sample of 2012 B inclusive MC processed with Reco13d.

   ChargedProtoANNPIDCommonBase. Default is now the offline location.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r6 2012-01-31 ================
! 2012-01-20 - Chris Jones
 - The annoying sporadic stderr messages from NeuroBayes seem to have returned.
   So, until understood squash them entirely by redirecting stderr
   to /dev/null *just* for the m_expert->nb_expert(m_inArray) call.
   Ugly, brutal, but works.

! 2012-01-18 - Chris Jones
 - Update the default network tuning, for all DataTypes, to MC11aTuneV2

   improvements will help in all cases.
 - Add a monitor for the ANN PID variables.

! 2012-01-11 - Chris Jones
 - Reinstate the MC11aV1 tunings, as they have been updated with new network
   tunings, that appear to have removed the spurious printouts ...

! 2011-12-21 - Chris Jones
 - Add default net tunings for DataTypes MC09 and 2008
 - Temporarily switch back to MC10TuneV1 for 2012 and 2011, as the new tunings
   are causing some annoying vogue printouts from the Neurobayes library ....

! 2011-12-20 - Chris Jones
 - Extend the Configurable to allow different net tunings by year

   releases (10.12 onwards) should suppress the messages from NB when loading
   the expertise files.

! 2010-12-03 - Chris Jones
 - Add python Configurable specifically for the ANN PID
