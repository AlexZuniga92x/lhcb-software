 - src/NeutralPPcrator.h,.cpp - new files
   new algoroithm for creationof neutral protoparticles.
   It is temporary preliminary version
   Need to fix a.s.a.p. : 
   hardcoded values for ID techniques from 100 to 103 beed to be  
   replaced with enums from ProtoParticle class (as soon as they defined)


! 2002-07-11 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce first version of algorithm to make ChargeProtoParticles
   (only rich and muonpid at the moment)
 - Introduce algorithm and tool for primary vertex reconstruction
