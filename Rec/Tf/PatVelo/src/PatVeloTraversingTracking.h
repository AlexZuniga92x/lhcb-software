  /** @class PatVeloTraversingTracking PatVeloTraversingTracking.h
   *
   * See talk in VELO Commissionig meeting 15/06/2009 for more info.
   *
   * This algorithm tries to find tracks from particles that traverse both
   * detector halves. As the pattern recognition programs split these tracks
   * into two tracks (one per half) this algorithm merges the candidates and
   * saves them in TES for later processing, for example by the VELO alignment.
   * The track matching works with three criteria:
   *
   * 1. The tracks have to have similar theta
   * 2. The tracks have to be in different VELO halves
   * 3. The tracks have to be parallel. This is done by extrapolating
   *    the tracks to large distances and checking if the distance betwen
   *    them remains constant.
   *    Essentially it's the same as a phi-criterion.
   *
   * Execute this algorithm AFTER pattern recognition but BEFORE the alignment.
   *
   *
   * N.B! The pattern recognition has to provide tracks in the local frame
   * for this algorithm to work properly.
   * For PatVeloGeneralTracking this is done by setting the option
   * PatVeloGeneralTracking.PatVeloTrackTool.TracksInHalfBoxFrame = True
   * same for PatVeloSpaceTool
