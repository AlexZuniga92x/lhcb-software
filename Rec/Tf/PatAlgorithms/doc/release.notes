!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r7 2008-07-02 ====================
! 2008-07-02 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: added code to deal better with cosmics, specifically:
   - strategy is to seed cosmics with the OT, then pick up IT hits which
     are close to the track (IT too small to have cosmic hits in more
     than one station)
   - when looking for cosmics in the OT, allow for tracks which migrate
     between upper and lower OT half
   - when recognizing the pattern in the stereo layers, use an alternate
     version of the findBestRange routine which does not assume that the
     track points back to the PV in yz projection (i.e. we use a simple
     combinatorial approach - in general, don't use the cosmic tuning on data
     obtained with beam on, it will most probably be too slow!)
 - add option file to find cosmics
   might need some tuning if e.g. layers v,x are missing in every station
   should work fine as long as either A or C side of OT is closed
   not well tuned yet (especially IT: nothing done/seen so far)
 - removed superfluous include file (fenv.h)

! 2008-06-29 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool:
   - tuning for new field map, now used per default
   - added new tuning for old field map, see
     options/PatSeedingTool-field047.opts
   - fixed a bug in the code calculating cluster positions, we now really do
     it the "Kisel" way (apart from the fact that we protect against division
     by 0, see below)
     we now use x_clus = (r_2 * x_1 + r_1 * x_2) / (r_1 + r_2), z_clus is done
     in the same way; to avoid divisions by zero, we take
       r_i = sqrt( (drift radius for hit i)^2 + measurement variance)
     i.e. the model is almost linear in r_drift, and it degenerates into the
     arithmetic mean of the wire positions if we run without using drift time
     information
   - made new option-controllable parameter OTNHitsLowThresh which gives the
     threshold below which OT only tracks have to satisfy stricter criteria
     (nicer than a literal 17 in the code)
   - add options to extract T station part of Forward tracks and add resulting
     tracks to output container (in addition to ignoring hits used by
     PatForward which was possible already previously)
 - PatSeedTrack: changes to follow new parametrisation in PatSeedingTool

! 2008-06-09 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix a possible divide-by-zero in PatDownstream, line 604.

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r6 2008-06-05 ====================
! 2008-06-05 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove unneccessary machine specific include (inexistent on Windows)

! 2008-06-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTool: various fixes to avoid dividing by zero (could and did happen
   when there were too few hits to determine fit parameters for the track
   model)
 - PatSeedingTool:
   - protect against a division by zero in initialize
   - increase m_minMomentum to 500 MeV - very few tracks lost
   - several adjustments triggered by the changes to PatSeedTool above
   - several changes to improve efficiency:
     - IT, per region: allow to form x candidates starting with all possible
       combinations of x layers in the tree stations
     - IT, per region: if few x hits are present in left/right boxes, we're
       probably in the dead region between the two ladders, so restrict
       stereo search as is already done for OT
     - IT/OT: additional pass looking for tracks passing between different IT
       regions and considering upper and lower OT halves for tracks near y=0,
       also relax requirements on tracks slightly in this case
     - OT, per region: additional pass for tracks at high fabs(y) where tracks
       are almost straight - so we set m_initialArrow temporarily to zero
   - some checks skipping unneccessary stages for trigger applications to keep
     the high speed from previous versions

! 2008-05-27 - Stephanie Hansmann-Menzemer
 - removed all float variables, replaced them by doubles

! 2008-05-23 - Johannes Albrecht
   - PatMatchTool.cpp: set unused variable quality2 to 0 (needed for Hlt interface)

! 2008-05-22 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Get IMatchTool.h from TrackInterfaces

! 2008-05-21 - Johannes Albrecht
   - PatMatchTool.h / .cpp: Add interface for implementation in Hlt

! 2008-05-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: fixed a bug in the y window calculation used in L0
   confirmation (no tacks are found in the L0 case)

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r5 2008-05-16 ====================
! 2008-05-15 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter, PatFwdRegionCounter:
   order of arguments to std::distance were given in reverse order, leading to
   slightly decreased performance in PatForward - swapped aruments so that
   order is correct now

! 2008-05-14 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter:
   - now uses boost::array instead of std::vector for arrays with known size
     at compile time -> see some small speed improvements for very hot events
   - class itself no longer templated on hit type, instead, methods taking
     hits (or iterators) are templated
 - PatFwdRegionCounter:
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
 - PatForwardTool, PatFwdTool:
   - follow-up changes for the changes in PatFwdPlaneCounter above
   - added some consts where possible to facilitate optimization by the
     compiler
 - PatSeedTool:
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
   - added a missing minus sign in the initial iteration of the stereo fit
   - added const to methods that do not change the object
 - PatSeedTrack:
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
   - added assignment operator
   - removed unused members
   - decreasingQuality() ordering class can now be used to sort containers
     of objects as well (if desired) - used to be only pointers to objects
 - PatSeedingTool:
   - in collectStereoHits: restore coordinates only for the hits we actually
     intend to consider further, not for the whole region
     dramatic speed improvement, as collectStereoHits is executed once for
     each candidate in xz
   - save low quality tracks with high impact y during per region search, add
     additional pass at the end of the algorithm to recover some of these
     tracks (if not too many used hits)
     this is fast (ca 0.7 ms/event), other improvements to algorithm actually
     save more time than we spend here
   - added code to account for OT tilt (dz/dy) before track in y is known
     (need to slightly widen search windows, otherwise, upper and lower half
     of OT show different efficiency at high fabs(y))
     this involves code needed to get dz/dy and z at y=0 for a region
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
   - regrouped property declarations so that related properties form groups
   - improved debugging code: per stage timing has not survived move from
     algorithm to tool, now resurrected
   - cut on drift radii now available as job option
   - when counting hits with some property to see if some cut is exceeded,
     we now stop early when we hit the boundary
   - improved memory management for temporary track candidates (read: faster)
   - methods for each pass of the algorithm over the hits to make separation
     clearer
   - added convenience functions and typedefs to access the hit manager
   - during xz search, cluster positions in the OT are now calculated the
     "Kisel" way, weighting each hit with 1/(r^2+sigma^2); this gives
     slightly better results because the parabola through these points is
     closer to the true track then
   - retuned some of the default properties for improved performance
   - now uses FastMomentumEstimate tool to have all the parametrizations
     available centrally in one place
   - prepareHits() now returns the number of hits returned by the hit
     manager - this might be useful for some applications and is easily
     ignored in all others
   - I'm sure I forgot something...
 - PatSeeding:
   - use private instance of PatSeedingTool to allow different configurations
     for different instances of the algorithm

! 2008-05-08 - Johannes Albrecht
 - PatMatchTool: - New implementation of PatMatch as tool
                         - public function: matchSingle for Hlt
                         - quality of match is now job option: maxMatchChi2
                         - momentum of matched tracks is calculated with tool
 - PatMatch: algorithm which only calls the tool

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r4p1 2008-03-25 ==================
! 2008-03-25 - Jan Amoraal
 - Removed white space from property impactCurrentNorm in PatMakeV0. 
   Python doesn't like it.
 - Fixed option in PatFwdTool.opts
  +  zMagnetParams -> ZMagnetParams
 
!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r4 2008-02-18 ====================
! 2008-02-18 - Manuel Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool can now take an optional state giving a hint where a track
   is to be found; this is useful for the HLT when confirming L0 candidates
   a track is searched for in a +/- one sigma window which is derived from the
   covariance matrix of the state which is extrapolated with a straight line
   model into the T stations
 - added job option which makes it possible to ignore hits used in a previous
   run of PatSeedingTool; application is again in HLT when trying to confirm
   several hypotheses in a combined window
 - added some missing comments to PatSeedingTool.cpp and the corresponding
   header file to better document member variables

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r3 2008-01-28 ====================
! 2008-01-28 - Manuel Schiller
 - added code to PatSeedingTool to perform better without magnetic field
   does not affect performance at all when running with default settings
 - added code to PatSeedingTool to allow better tuning when running with
   a misaligned detector
   does not affect performance at all when running with default settings
 - added code to PatSeedTool to fix a corner case which could produce NaNs
   as track parameters:
   In a few cases, the line fit in y projection could start to oscillate
   wildly. The x coordinates of hits are modified according to the track's
   y, which causes an even more violent shift in y parameters on the next
   iteration - eventually, you'll find NaNs all over the place. The bad thing
   about this is that these hits with NaNs as coordinates may cause the fit
   of other tracks in that event to fail as well.
   To put a stop to this, the fit will now discard tracks which change their
   slope in yz projection by more than 1.0. This improves efficiency and
   decreases ghost rate slightly.

! 2008-01-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Modify again PatMatch to use std::map<int,bool>, which is correct in that order.

! 2008-01-16 - Olivier Callot
 - Modify PatMatch: The std::map<bool,int> was no longer working properly.
   It is replaced by a simple vector of size = max key value.

! 2008-01-10 - Olivier Callot
 - New algorithm PatMakeV0 from Maurince enayoun to build V0 candidates
   Requites PV to be foudn first.
   Resulting V0s in RecVErtexLocation::V) and track pairs in Rec/Tracl/FromKs.

! 2007-12-19 - Olivier Callot
 - Modify PatDownstream to tag TT used hits with the option SeedFilter.
 - Use new enum values to tag TT hits with meaningful names.
