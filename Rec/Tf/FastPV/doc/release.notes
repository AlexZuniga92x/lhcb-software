!========================= FastPV v1r0 2011-12-15 ============================
! 2011-11-28 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix a gcc46 warning (variable set but never used)

! 2011-11-25 - Olivier Callot
 - Cleanup of no longer ised feature: Backward track counting
 - Add 90 micron MS error in quadrature.
 - Ready for use by HLT1: SetFilterPassed(false) if no PV

! 2011-11-23 - Olivier Callot
 - Iterate, first with a large number of tracks (30% of total), then as usual.
 - Work with unused tracks in each iteration
 - Do the final serach without grouping constraints
 - Remove the request for backward tracks...

! 2011-11-22 - Olivier Callot
 - Try a vertex with unused tracks if no vertex found (low mult. events)

! 2011-11-22 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix properly the backward request!
 - New algorithm FastPVMonitor to monitor the vertices.

! 2011-11-22 - Olivier Callot
 - Request backward tracks only if the numbe rof tracks is between 
   MinTrackInPV and twice that.

! 2011-11-21 - Olivier Callot
 - Change the tuning after fixing the checker. No longer cleanup of 
   tracks on two vertices. Larger tolerances.

! 2011-11-18 - Olivier Callot
 - New package, with one algorithm, FastPVFinder.
   It searches the PV from the Velo tracks, in a fast and efficient way
   It requires a proper knowledge of teh beam position, obtained from the 
   Velo position.
