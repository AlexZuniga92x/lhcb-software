  . python/HltMonitors/ConfiguredHltMonitors.py
    o Run EventTimeMonitor (need Rec/RecAlgs r138776)
    o Run HltRateMoniror instance for MB lines

- In MuonPIDChecker v5r3
  . Added protection when retrieving MuonPID and Muon track containers

- In GlobalReco v6r42
  . Change default track chi^2 cut from 0->10 to 0->5, to reflect tracking
    changes. Note that by default in the tracking clone killing a cut of 0->3 is
    now applied, so this cut does nothing. Retain though as a sanity check.
  . Remove context() specific default job options from ChargedProtoParticleMoni

- In LumiAlgs v7r6
  . Added event time ordering and output compression (bz2) capabilities
    to DumpLumiEvents algorithm

- In RichRecSys v4r5
  . Make the default list of tracks used in the HLT the same as offline.
  . Update offline track chi^2 cut from 0->10 to 0->5. Tracking now applies
    its own cut anyway (0->3 currently) so this no longer does anything, but
    keep just for sanity check.
  . Improve the way the track types are set, to fix a bug in the HLT where the
    requested track types to use was not always respected.

- In FastVelo v1r8, v1r9
  . Added a ProcStatus when clone killing fired to make monitoring easier
  . Added a sanity check just before conversion to LHCb::Tracks that if there is
    more than 1 track for every 4 clusters the event should be very aggressivly
    clone killed (default only 10% overlap allowed). To fix cases of off axis
    beam backgrounds causing a combinatoric explosion in the number of VELO
    tracks made and subsequent processing time. See Savannah bug #93550.

  . PatAddTTCoord: Adapting parameters to optimal values found in MC11a and 
    fixing the slope at zMSPoint instead of TTField in the chi2 fit.
  . PatDownstream: Added options to set the output location of the matching and
    forward tracking in PatDownstream. Now used seeds and tt hits can be removed
    also in the HLT.
  . PatForwardTool: Bug fix in PatForward, flag for left right ambiguity is now
    reset when collecting hits. Before independence of different iterations
    of the Forward tracking was broken.

  . StateInitTool: set velo momentum the way it used to be done in
    TrackPrepareVelo (temporarily?).

- In TrackUtils v1r46
  . Added TrackBestTrackCreator.

This version uses Gaudi v23r1 and LHCb v34r1

- Candidate release for HLT in 2012.
  Development release for Stripping 18 test

- Packages updated: Calo/CaloReco v5r14, Muon/MuonTrackMonitor v2r6,
    Rec/LumiAlgs v7r4, Rich/RichRecQC v2r57, Tf/FastVelo v1r7,
    Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r18, Tf/TrackSys v7r1, Tr/TrackFitEvent v5r14,
    Tr/TrackFitter v4r4, Tr/TrackMonitors v1r37, Tr/TrackTools v4r12,
    Tr/PatPV v3r22

- In Calo/CaloReco v5r14
  . CaloMergedPi0Alg: Fix potential memory leak, probably never fired
    (Coverity defect 17572)
  . Fix UNINIT_CTOR defects
  . Fix trivial icc remarks

- In Muon/MuonTrackMonitor v2r6
  . remove line that sets "NodeFitter.BiDirectionalFit" in configuration

- In Rec/LumiAlgs v7r4
  . Slightly more informative warning message for missing FSR data
  . Introduce option IgnoreDQFlags, gived warning when set
  . Introduce logic in LumiIntegrateFSR to skip integration based on DQflags
  . Update unit tests
  . Make explicit that FilterFillingScheme is not used before 2011
  . Add protection for data beyond 2012, requiring explicit update
  . Initialize 2012 behaviour with safest possible condition
  . Fix bug with minor effect (1E-4) in LumiIntegrateFSR
  . Add missing dependencies for tests, following reorganisation of GaudiConf
  . Remove imports from GaudiConf

- In Rich/RichRecQC v2r57
  . Added sequence control in RichHPDFlashMoni

- In Tf/FastVelo v1r7
  . Improve for large IP tracks:
    o Allow change of zone in RZ tracks, but at least 3 in the same zone
      Remove the test that all R hits should be in the same zone later...
    o Count the total cluster size. If average > 1.9, allow tracks with
      higher quality factor (+1.0) (i.e. when two tracks overlap in RZ)
    o Reduce the deltaPhi tolerance for backward tracks (speed)
  . Use the new 'wasDecoded' flag of the Velo sensor to count missed sensors.
  . Reserve space in vectors. (Feed back from Sasha Mazuroz's talk on 6/2/2012)
  . Copy vectors using the insert method.-> -4% time.

- In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r18
  . PatDownstream: make sure we copy all three states in T to help the fast fit
    in HLT
  . PatForwardTool: 
    o Changed parametrisation of first search window in x.
      Required to add property "MagnetKickParams" to PatForwardTool.
    o Bug fix in PatForward in part which uses momentum estimate.
  . PatForwardTool, PatFwdTool:
    o Fixed part which uses momentum estimate. This part of the code was not used
      anywhere or if it was used it could not work.
    o Removed property "RangeErrorFraction" and changed default value of
      "MinRange". To make sure that the user knows that a momentum estimate is
      used, added property "UseMomentumEstimate" which is false by default.
  . Change calls to std::sort where hits were sorted by a potentially unstable
    sorting criterium to use std::stable_sort; the reason is that there is a
    possibility that we end up with more than one hit at the same z (e.g. two
    hits in same layer), so the result of the sort will depend on the
    implementation of std::sort - using std::stable_sort instead avoids that
    (these changes have to be applied in addition to those in Tf/TfKernel to
    fix differences observed between gcc 4.3 and gcc 4.6)
  . PatFwdTrackCandidate: avoid some memory allocations in handling the vector
    of PatFwdHits
  . FastForwardTool, PatAddTTCoord: replace std::vector by boost::array to avoid
    memory allocations
  . PatDownTrack: avoid needless copying of parameter vectors, preallocate
    space for hit container
  . work on const correctness (where possible)

- In Tf/TrackSys v7r1
  . Fix a bug in python/TrackSys/PatChecking.py which causes the
    TrackEffChecker not to be run on Velo tracks if FastVelo is used
  . Remove unnecessary import from RecoTracking.py

- In Tr/TrackFitEvent v5r14
  . Adapt KalmanFitResult and FitNode to change in Measurement
  . Improve speed of FitNode::computeFilteredState

- In Tr/TrackFitter v4r4
  . Changes to revive functionality of 'forward only' fit
  . Increased minimum number of hits left in outlier removal
  . Small improvement in MasterFitter::outlierRemoved to call smoothing less
    often (only affects HLT)
  . Fix in TrackKalmanFilter to make profiling easier

- In Tr/TrackMonitors v1r37
  . Extend range of histogram for 'Track:history' flag such that we can actually
    see FastVelo

- In Tr/TrackTools v4r12
  . Several changes to TrackStateInitTool to get better track initialization
  . Use Warning(...) instead of warning() << for messages in MuonTTTrack, so
    they eventually get suppressed, and move some info() to debug()
    (for stripping).

- In Tr/PatPV v3r22
  . Remove usage of WeigthsVector from PatPV
  . Make LSAdaptPV3DFitter faster (for HLT)
  . Update PatPVOffline to no longer create a separate 'WeightsVector', but
    instead to store the track weights directly in the RecVertex class, which
    now supports this.
  . Update PVOfflineRecalculate to take the track weights direct from the PV
    itself, instead of trying to load the now obsolete weights vector.

This version uses Gaudi v23r0 and LHCb v34r0

- Development release in preparation for 2012 data taking

- Packages updated: Muon/MuonTrackMonitor v2r5, Rec/ChargedProtoANNPID v1r6,
    Rec/GlobalReco v6r40, Rec/LumiAlgs v7r3, Rec/RecConf v2r5,
    Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r33, Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r17, Tf/PatVeloTT v3r17,

    Tr/TrackProjectors v2r30, Tr/TrackTools v4r11, Tr/TrackUtils v1r44,
    Tr/PatPV v3r21, Velo/VeloRecMonitors v2r17

- In MuonTrackMonitor v2r5
  . Move 2d histograms to expert mode

- In ChargedProtoANNPID v1r6
  . The annoying sporadic stderr messages from NeuroBayes seem to have returned.
    So, until understood squash them entirely by redirecting stderr and stdout
    to /dev/null *just* for the m_expert->nb_expert(m_inArray) call.
  . Make the network tuning MC11aTuneV2 the default for all data types, as the
    improvements will help in all cases.
  . Add a monitor for the ANN PID variables.
  . Extend the Configurable to allow different net tunings by year
  . Remove truncation of P and Pt variables
  . Add various GE variables from RecSummary
  . Add a few more Tracking variables

- In GlobalReco v6r40
  . Try and fix the qmtests
  . Add the slot DataType to the Configurable, and pass this on to the ANN PID
    Configurable
  . Remove obsolete properties for inputs and outputs from
    ChargedProtoParticleMaker

- In LumiAlgs v7r3
  . Follow changes in RootCnv v1r12
  . Protect FilterFillingScheme for missing Magnet State condition (in 2008)
  . Prepare migration to Gaudi v23:
    o Remove GaudiPoolDb run time dependency, replace it with RELAX
    o Remove tests that require POOL:
      lumialgs.framework.poolfsrwriter, lumialgs.framework.poolreadpoolfsr
    o Put output file of former lumialgs.framework.poolfsrwriter test in SVN, to
      continue testing with lumialgs.framework.rootreadpoolfsr (testPoolFsr.dst)

- In RecConf v2r5
  . Add a ANN PID monitor algorithm to the PROTO Monitoring sequence
  . Propagate the DataType to the GlobalReco Configurable
  . Adapt to change in TrackV0Finder

- In RichRecTrackTools v1r33
  . Add new implementation of the "detailed" track segment creator that uses
    the tracking TrackStateProvider tool, instead of extrapolators.

- In PatAlgorithms v4r17
  . PatMatchTool: 
    o Make sure we copy all three states in T to help the fast fit in HLT
    o Clean up and streamline the code somewhat while we're at it;
      one minor change in behaviour: if momentum estimate tool fails (as far as I
      can see, the current implementation cannot fail), we don't touch the
      momentum estimates of states on a newly created track, we rely on the
      algorithms which supply these tracks to do something reasonable in that
      case
  . include somewhat more fine-grained timing measurements in PatSeedingTool for
    the initial x search (not active by default)
  . for trigger use, add the NDblOTHitsInXSearch property which cuts on the
    number of double hits in the OT (i.e. hits in two monolayers of the same
    layer) for the three layers which are used to form the initial search
    parabola if that number is lower then NDblOTHitsInXSearch, the candidate is
    abandoned early
    The default value for the new property is 0, so the default behaviour does
    not change, however, putting 2 there in the trigger saved O(20%) execution
    time while only 0.5-1% of efficiency is lost (all momenta, for p > 5GeV, the
    efficiency loss is on the order of 0.1-0.3%)

- In PatVeloTT v3r17
  . Fix handling of CondDB updates in PatTTMagnetTool: Z layer positions were
    not being updated

- In TrackFitEvent v5r13
  . Fix problem in reinterpret_cast that only appears in optimization in 
    kalmanfitresult
  . Make sure chi2 cache of trackfitresult is invalidated if a measurement is
    deactivated
  . add total accumulated chi2 of filter to node. use this in kalmanfitresult
  . add ranges to fitnodes in kalmanfitresult

- In TrackFitter v4r3

    rejection

- In TrackMonitors v1r36
  . Also do TrackVertexMonitors in online mode, to get PV position in online
    Brunel

- In TrackTools v4r11
  . added missing include to TrackHitCollector

- In TrackUtils v1r44
  . Update the default list of track states to keep in TrackToDST
  . Some improvements to TrackToDST
    o Fully support stripping of Muon Tracks
    o Strip Track::Velo tracks in the same way as Track::VeloR
  . remove use of Track::nodes() in TrackV0Finder

- In PatPV v3r21
  . Introduce beamspot constraint into PVSeedTool to make PatPV3D faster which
    gives a factor between 2 or 3 in exe time when switching from 3D PVSeed3DTool
    to PVSeedTool, lower false PV rate and lower PV->SV mistakes, same
    performance for other parameters like resolution and PV efficiency

- In VeloRecMonitors v2r17
  . Added new plot for "high multiplicity, # clusters", with logic to get
    cluster multiplicity from raw event
  . Increased upper bin limit on the default "# VELO clusters" plot to 6000
  . fixed high-multiplicity code
  . Removed the "# VELO clusters 2" histogram. It has been superseded by the
    algorithm HighMultiplicityMonitor in Velo/VeloDataMonitor.

      flag. If the flag was set to false it would still do all the work, but
      simply not return anything. Replaced this by two calls: one that simply
      returns a boolean if tracks are clones and another one that sets the flags.
