! Responsible : Heinrich Schindler
! Purpose     : Pattern recognition for the Pixel detector of the upgraded LHCb
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2014-02-27 - Kurt Rinnert
 - use new features of DeVPSensor to speed up 3D point building.
 - additional various optimizations (cache global transforms, PrPixelModule 
   object pool ...).
 - added possibility to do clustering and 3D hit building directly from
   super pixel raw banks.
 - added clustering algorithm creatinf VPLiteClusters from super pixel raw
   bank.

!========================= PrPixel v1r5 2014-02-19 =========================
! 2014-02-13 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Renamed PatPixel* to PrPixel*
 - Bugfix (chi2 cut on short tracks was not applied)
 - Remove unused functions from PrPixelTracking

! 2014-02-09 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Moved package from Tf/PatPixel to Pr/PrPixel

! 2014-01-09 - Tim Head
 - Restructered code in hottest part of PatPixelTracking

   Precompute the answer to common lookups like
   whether a module has any hits or the value
   of the largest X hit.

!========================= PatPixel v1r4 2013-12-10 =========================
! 2013-12-05 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Removed unused variables, changed default values

!========================= PatPixel v1r3 2013-10-24 =========================
! 2013-10-23 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Changed default value of UseSlopeCorrection to False

!========================= PatPixel v1r2 2013-10-01 =========================
! 2013-09-27 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Renamed PatPixelSensor to PatPixelModule to reflect new geometry
 - Added flag to use slope dependent correction in position calculation or not
 - Some cleanup in PatPixelTracking 

! 2013-09-25 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Modifications for use with new XML and detector element hierarchy
 - Moved track extrapolation to PatPixelTracking
 - Temporarily removed trackUpstream method
 - Moved position calculation to PatPixelHitManager 
 - Removed printf statements from helper classes
 
! 2013-09-18 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix uninitialised counter in PatPixelHitManager.h

! 2013-0-17 - Tim Evans
 - Removed some obsolete code / commented out PatPixelSensor code that is not used
 - Changed Maximum scattering parameter to a GaudiParameter (MaxScattering)

! 2013-09-09 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Follow VP detector element and channel ID changes (r162190, 162191)
 - Fix unused variable warning from previous commit

! 2013-09-03 - Pawel Jalocha
 - tracks fit on multiple scattering model, instead of a straight line,
   improves hit efficiency (and IP resolution as a result)
 - code not very clean and not final: more a test of the new concept

! 2013-08-25 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Replace direct calls to DeVPSquareType 

!========================= PatPixel v1r1 2013-06-03 =========================
! 2013-05-28 - Wouter Hulsbergen
 - implemented a simple fixed-noise kalman filter to improve IP resolution

! 2013-05-24 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Include missing PatKernel dependency

!========================= PatPixel v1r0 2013-02-14 =========================
! 2013-02-08 - Diego Martinez Santos
 - Added correction to the bias in cluster positions, as well as a slope
   dependent correction for two pixel clusters. 
   This might cause for the moment a loss of speed.

! 2013-02-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation with CMake.

! 2013-02-01 - Sascha Stahl
 - Added CMake file

! 2013-01-30 - Olivier Callot
 - Add option "ClearHits" to clear the hits, for rerunning the VP pattern twice.

! 2012-12-09 - Pawel Jalocha
 - debug histograms added (activate with DEBUG_HISTO)
 - added comments, as I understand the code works

! 2012-01-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Re-implementation of the algorithm, based on finding a pair of consecutive hits
   and extrapolating in both directions.
   Tested on 900 events: 0.9% ghosts, 99.7% efficient, 0.5% clones, 1.35 ms/event
   Improvements are possible, but a better clustering is probably the most 
   important one

! 2012-01-10 - Olivier Callot
 - First version. The overall structure is taken form FastVelo.
   New logic to make the search: Find enough hits in a seed region before 
   extrapolating. This seed region can extend acroos the half detector boundary.

   Initial performance is great:  <2% ghosts, >99.5% efficiency for long > 5 GeV,
                                  <0.5% clones, and only < 1.5 ms per event. 
      This is obtained on a limited sample.
