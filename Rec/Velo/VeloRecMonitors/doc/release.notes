! 2013-06-24 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix clang32 warning

! 2013-06-20 - Christoph Hombach
	- Added selection for overlap tracks with track quality cuts (ll 659). For selecting overlap-tracks uncomment l 660 (Will implement an more elegant way soon).
	- Added different approach for left-right tracks. selectmethod 0: Select Left/Righttracks by direction of slope, 1: Select Left/Righttracks by number of hits in Velo Half, selectmethod 1: Left/Righttracks are tracks that have only hits in the left/right half. To select change l 1097 (An more elegant way will be implemented)
	- Added plots that show the hits on the first sensor a track hits

! 2013-06-20 - Michel De Cian
 - Fix a warning due to int <-> unsigned int comparison in VeloTrackMonitorNT

! 2012-08-17 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added PU only average occupancy histogram. This allows to display these
   separately online and put different alarms on them. In fact the PU has to
   be taken out of the overall sensor average histogram to make it work with 
   the alarms in the online monitoring (online is running an older version as
   of now). So we probably need another histogram with only VELO.

!========================= VeloRecMonitors v2r20 2012-07-24 =====================

! 2012-05-15 - Silvia Borghi
 - Updated the "VeloTrackMonitorNT" algorithm:
   add several variables to all the ntuples (per evt, per track, per cluster on track)

   coupling effect of M2 routing line

! 2012-03-12 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - changed default for occupancy monitoring to not periodically reset
   occupancy histograms - this is needed to make the offline monitoring of
   dead/noisy channels more reliable; online plots will be done by setting
   this property in the online jobs to the old default

!========================= VeloRecMonitors v2r17 2012-01-31 =====================

   algorithm HighMultiplicityMonitor in Velo/VeloDataMonitor.

!========================= VeloRecMonitors v2r16 2011-12-15 ==================

   based on ZS data during normal data taking:
   - most plots have labelled axes now
   - add a few monitoring plots for dead/noisy channels
   - some changes in the internal structure which make the algorithm a factor
     35 faster (histograms are now updated only every 255 events)
   - some effort to make the XML and txt files with dead/noisy channels a bit
     more informative (now have comments with who and where the list was
     produced, and which run numbers were seen)
   - removed some obsolete plots after discussion with Marco Gersabeck

! 2011-11-22 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix trivial gcc warnings and icc remarks

! 2009-01-22 - Marco Gersabeck
- now check for previously unchecked status codes

!======================= VeloRecMonitors v1r3 2009-01-12 =====================
! 2008-12-01 - Marco Gersabeck
- check for zero pitch in residual normalisation

!======================= VeloRecMonitors v1r2 2008-11-21 =====================
! 2008-11-17 - Marco Gersabeck
- normalised also unbiased residual plots

! 2008-11-14 - Marco Gersabeck
- changed residual plots to normalised residuals w.r.t. binary resolution
  adapted alignment monitoring accordingly

! 2008-11-13 - Marco Gersabeck
- added extra plots for alignment online monitoring
  to be switched on by setting AlignMoniBasic to true

! 2008-11-03 - Sadia Khalil
- extra plots (momentum, clusters per event, angle) have been added in
  VeloTrackMonitor as an offline option
- Put the "Clusters per Event for R sensors and R+Phi" as an offline option
- fixed bugs while running on "Best" tracks

!======================= VeloRecMonitors v1r1 2008-10-03 =====================
! 2008-10-03 - Sadia Khalil
 - first version of the track-based monitoring algorithm VeloTrackMonitor:
   - default settings are for online monitoring
   - user options to switch from online to offline analysis are available 
     for unbiased residuals and hitmap plots

! 2008-10-02 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - added StatusCode missing

! 2008-09-17 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added number of clusters per sensor to cluster monitor, off by default.

! 2008-09-15 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added sampling monitor plots separated for A and C side.

!======================= VeloRecMonitors v1r0 2008-09-08 =====================
! 2008-09-06 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Remove addition of velo to Moni list. This is done in Brunel Configuration.py.

! 2008-09-02 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - *** version to analyse end-of-August data ***
 - histo for (# clusters) gets only entries when (# clusters)>0
 - introduced separate histos for R and Phi sensors

! 2008-08-31 - Malcolm John
 - Tinker with the dummy variables generated in the LumiRegion monitor
 - Inport a LiteCluster monitor meant for running in the HLT

! 2008-08-31 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added beam position monitor (currently produces dummy random positions)
 - added separate options file for running online
 - missing input containers are no longer an error condition

! 2008-08-24 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - settings to run over Friday 22nd LHC injection test: settings to look at
   specific sensors on
 - related options file added
 - improvements to R-correlation plot
   
! 2008-08-21 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - VeloClusterMonitor: added R correlation plots for a few
   consecutive R sensors
 - new algorithm, VeloSamplingMonitor, to monitor ADC distributions versus
   the time sampling (as stored in Prev, Next, etc.)

! 2008-08-20 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - added histogram to monitor active chip links versus sensor number
 - some bins adjusted

! 2008-08-19 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - added functionality to deal with clusters in non-default paths
   (e.g.: VeloClusterMonitor will produce histograms under "/Velo/Next/" if
   the clusters are in "Raw/Velo/Next/Clusters" or "Next/Raw/Velo/Clusters")
 - Python options added to run the default VELO monitoring in Brunel

! 2008-08-18 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - first version of the clusters monitoring algorithm VeloClusterMonitor,
   largely based on the versions in the to-become-obsolete monitoring packages

! 2008-08-15 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - creation of the package
 - creation of a base class for all VELO reconstruction monitoring algorithms
