! 2008-08-24 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - settings to run over Friday 22nd LHC injection test: settings to look at
   specific sensors on
 - related options file added
 - improvements to R-correlation plot
   
! 2008-08-21 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - VeloClusterMonitor: added R correlation plots for a few
   consecutive R sensors
 - new algorithm, VeloSamplingMonitor, to monitor ADC distributions versus
   the time sampling (as stored in Prev, Next, etc.)

! 2008-08-20 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - added histogram to monitor active chip links versus sensor number
 - some bins adjusted

! 2008-08-19 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - added functionality to deal with clusters in non-default paths
   (e.g.: VeloClusterMonitor will produce histograms under "/Velo/Next/" if
   the clusters are in "Raw/Velo/Next/Clusters" or "Next/Raw/Velo/Clusters")
 - Python options added to run the default VELO monitoring in Brunel

! 2008-08-18 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - first version of the clusters monitoring algorithm VeloClusterMonitor,
   largely based on the versions in the to-become-obsolete monitoring packages

! 2008-08-15 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - creation of the package
 - creation of a base class for all VELO reconstruction monitoring algorithms
