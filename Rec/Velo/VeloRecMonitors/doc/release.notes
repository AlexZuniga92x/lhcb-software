! 2009-06-05 - Kurt Rinnert
 - bugfix in VeloClusterMonitor, the scale on the new channel occupancy plots
   was wrong.

! 2009-06-05 - Kurt Rinnert
 - VeloClusterMonitor: added occupancy plots in channel order, changed
   occupancy scale to %, fixed conversion warnings in some calls to plot1D,
   made the highest bin in number of clusters plot a visible overflow bin.
 - VeloSamplingMonitor: added new plots of cluster ADC values vs. TAE
   separated for top and bottom.

 - added to VeloClusterMonitor.cpp plots for seeding and inclusion thresholds

! 2009-06-03 - Marco Cattaneo

   properly, snprintf is not a standard C++ function

! 2009-04-30 - Kurt Rinnert

! 2009-04-27 - Kurt Rinnert
 - shortened and simplified histogram name in sampling monitor in order to
   avoid potential problems with HistDB and presenter.

! 2009-04-14 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - VeloMonitorBase updated to be able to deal with the printing of options
 - algos run in Brunel set not to print their options
 - VeloExpertClusterMonitor: removal of several warning messages

 - Several additions to VeloLumiRegionMonitor and VeloHltLiteClusterMonitor inc.:
  trend plotting for the last 1000 lumi region position measurements
  profiling of position and occupancy vs LHC bunchId

 - Add two gaudirun scripts that add my histos into the histoDB and layout my pages
  VeloLumiRegion_addToHistDb.py
  VeloLumiRegion_setupPages.py

 - Now there are two almost identical run scripts in the options directory
  VeloLumiRegionMon.opts
  VeloLumiRegionMon_onFiles.opts

! 2009-04-14 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - VeloExpertClusterMonitor: several simplifications profiting from
   VeloMonitorBase inheritance

   during initialization

! 2009-04-03 - James Mylroie-Smith

   clusters and tracks with options to split sensors by regions

!======================= VeloRecMonitors v1r5 2009-03-10 =====================
! 2009-03-05 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - reduced (unnecessary high) binning of a few histos in VeloTrackMonitor

! 2009-03-04 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix an untested StatusCode

! 2009-03-03 - Sadia Khalil
- introduce new plots/profile histograms 
- measurement of +ve and -ve charges
- biased/unbiased residuals versus momentum profiles for +ve and -ve charges.
  This requires the option of Forward tracks.

  VeloTrackMonitor as an offline option
- Put the "Clusters per Event for R sensors and R+Phi" as an offline option
- fixed bugs while running on "Best" tracks

!======================= VeloRecMonitors v1r1 2008-10-03 =====================
! 2008-10-03 - Sadia Khalil
 - first version of the track-based monitoring algorithm VeloTrackMonitor:

 - added histogram to monitor active chip links versus sensor number
 - some bins adjusted

! 2008-08-19 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - added functionality to deal with clusters in non-default paths
   (e.g.: VeloClusterMonitor will produce histograms under "/Velo/Next/" if
   the clusters are in "Raw/Velo/Next/Clusters" or "Next/Raw/Velo/Clusters")
 - Python options added to run the default VELO monitoring in Brunel

! 2008-08-18 - Eduardo Rodrigues
