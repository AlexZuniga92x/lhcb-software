! 2011-02-10 - Chris Jones
 - fix various icc warnings

! 2011-02-07 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to removal of depreciated typedefs

!==================== RichRecTemplateRings v1r4p1 2010-05-21 =================
! 2010-05-12 - Rob Lambert
 - Review of warnings

!==================== RichRecTemplateRings v1r4 2010-03-19 ===================
! 2010-03-05 - Chris Jones
 - Various changes to support the configuration of multiple reconstruction 
   sequences in the same application. Needed to support neccessary changes in 
   HLT2.

!==================== RichRecTemplateRings v1r3 2010-02-15 ===================
! 2010-01-28   - Sajan Easo
 -  Added a fix to avoid selecting bands around the expected radius.
 -  Added a fix for the cases with zero number of hits in input to avoid crash.

!==================== RichRecTemplateRings v1r2 2010-01-21 ===================

!==================== RichRecTemplateRings v1r1p1 2009-10-20 =================
! 2009-12-16- Sajan Easo
 - Added additional options to use with no-Magnetic field data
! 2009-10-07- Sajan Easo
 - Added an extra option for selecting all tracks for Cosmics data.
   This allows the TT tracks to be used for ring finding.

!==================== RichRecTemplateRings v1r1 2009-09-03 ===================
! 2009-09-03 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove obsolete file src/RichRecTemplateRings_dll.cpp

! 2009-09-01 - Sajan Easo
  - Added an extra option to activate for saturated tracks only
    for the RichTargetDataConfigAlg. This would speed up the cpu.

! 2009-07-30 - Chris Jones
 - Replace all endreq with endmsg

!==================== RichRecTemplateRings v1r0 2009-06-17 ===================
! 2009-06-15 - Sajan Easo
  - Configuration.py improved to include the comparison to MCtruth. This can
    be activated from the Configuration.py of the package RichRecQC.
  - Storage of results itno  LHCb::RichRecRing updated so that Cherenkov angle 
    is stored instead of Cherenkov Radius. Also the RichRecPixels associated to
    each ring are also stored.  The storage is done in RichRingMasterAlg.cpp
  - The comparison of results to MC truth is improved in 
    RichRingMCCompareNtup and RichMCTruthAcquireAlg.

! 2009-06-05 - Chris Jones
 - Move everything to the namespace Rich::Rec::TemplateRings::

! 2009-03-23  Sajan Easo
  - Added an option to  have a max number of RichRecSegments used per radiator
    in order to limit the cpu time used. The limit for each radiator can be
    set using the options. The default configuraiton is to 
    use up to 15 segments per radiator. 

! 2009-03-19  Sajan Easo
 - Added couple of options switches in RichRingMasterAlg
 - Improved the cpu time in a minor way by configuring the 
   FFT Plan at initialize stage in RichFFPlan.cpp
 - Added a switch in RichTargetDataConfigAlg.cp to select only tracks above
   a Cherenkov Momentum Threshold.
 - In  RichRingReconParam.cpp the aerogel rings are swiched off as
   a default setup. They can be be switched on using the python options.

! 2009-03-08  Sajan Easo
  Fixed a typo in RichRingRecMass
 
! 2007-08-23  Sajan Easo
 - Output put into the RichPID class

! 2007-07-23  Sajan Easo
 - modifications to the way the info from the radiators are combined.

! 2007-07-13  Sajan Easo
 - Release of first version.
