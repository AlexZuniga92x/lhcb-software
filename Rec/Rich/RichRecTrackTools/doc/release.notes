! Responsible : Chris Jones
! Purpose     : Utility tracks tools for RICH reconstruction algorithms
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r42 2016-03-17 =======================
! 2016-03-10 - Chris Jones
 - Some more C++11 modernisations.
 - Speed up the ExpectedTrackSignal::hasRichInfo by limiting it on only
   checking the lightest hypothesis (largest CK ring). In practise if
   this ring is not in the HPD acceptance, checking the heavier smaller
   rings is highly unlikely to change that decision, and not doing so
   allows a number of ring ray tracings to thus be avoided.

! 2016-03-04 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to changes in DeRichBeamPipe.

! 2016-03-02 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to be move of some basic methods to a utility header file 
   in Rich/RichKernel.

! 2016-03-01 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to changes in ray tracing enums.

! 2016-02-28 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to removal of typedefs in RichDet.

! 2016-02-02 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to removal of old backwards compatibility typedefs.

! 2016-01-29 - Chris Jones
 - A few more clean ups

! 2016-01-28 - Chris Jones
 - Add a flag to RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to turn on/off the
   State sanity checks. Default now off to save CPU.
 - (Experimental) use of move semantics when constructing 
   LHCb::RichTrackSegment in RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks.
   (There appears to be a modest improvement from using this on the
   Rich::RadIntersection::Vector vector.)
 - Set the Deuteron threshold information in ExpectedTrackSignal.

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r41 2016-01-28 =========================
! 2016-01-21 - Chris Jones
 - A few more C++11 modernisations.

! 2016-01-18 - Chris Jones
 - Update the Cherenkov angle tool to determine the best guess photon emission
   point using the tool interface rather than directly from the track segment.

! 2016-01-14 - Chris Jones
 - A few more C++11 cleanups (nullptr instead of NULL etc.).

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r40p1 2015-10-13 ======================
! 2015-08-12 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove #include of obsolete Gaudi headers

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r40 2015-04-21 ========================
! 2015-04-20 - Chris Jones
 - General c++11 clean up.

! 2015-03-09 - Chris Jones
 - Downgrade some info messages to debug level.
 - Load some tools as shared instances, to avoid unnecessary duplicate tools
   from being instanciated when running the reconstruction with the split
   track groups enabled.

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r39 2015-02-23 ========================
! 2015-02-20 - Chris Jones
 - Add a new option (enabled by default) to move states in 
   DetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks using a StateProvider using the
   stateFromTrajectory method. Faster, with no signficant loss of resolution.

! 2015-02-12 - Chris Jones
 - Clean up internal interface used by DetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to
   avoid passing around unique_ptr instances by reference.

! 2015-02-06 - Chris Jones
 - Add a new (off by default) option to RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to
   use a TrackTraj object move states to the RICH radiator entry and exit 
   positions.
 - Add an option to RichFunctionalCKResForRecoTracks to use the fast geometry
   when calculating the radiation length the track traverses in the RICH
   radiator volumes. Off by default.
 - Various CPU improvements (use VDT math functions etc.).

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r38 2015-01-14 ========================
! 2015-01-14 - Chris Jones
 - Make the HLT defaults in RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks the same as
   for Offline.

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r37 2014-07-14 ====================
! 2014-07-11 - Chris Jones
 - Retire the (incomplete and never used) class
   RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracksStateProvider.
 - Extend the class RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to dynamically use an
   instance of the TrackStateProvider tool to create missing track states as
   needed. Restores the ability of the RICH reconstruction to run in tracks
   saved to DSTs, which was broken when the DST format was updated to purge
   the tracks of states not needed downstream.

!========================= RichRecTrackTools v1r36 2014-02-19 ====================
! 2014-02-08 - Chris Jones
 - Clean up the last commit a little (really needs to be properly reviewed)
   once we no long need to support various different MaPMT options for the
   Upgrade...
 - Remove some hacks neccessary when mixing c++11 and non-c++11 builds.

   RICH2 for upgrade.

! 2010-10-15 - Chris Jones
 - Remove caching of refractive indices in CherenkovAngle tool. Doesn't 
   really save any cpu time, and breaks whenever the refractive index is
   updated on the fly.
 - Add a new method saturatedCherenkovTheta that returns the saturated CK theta
   angle for a given track segment.
 - Update the expected track signal tool to use new refractive index interface 
   method that returns the threshold momentum for a track segment, taking into
   account the radiator volumes traversed.
 - Add a scale factor job option to the expected signal tool that scales the
   threshold momentum when used to determine if a track is above or below 
   threshold. Potentially useful to allow a little leaway in the decision.

   are actually needed.

!====================== RichRecTrackTools v1r24p1 2010-09-01 =================

 - Tighten up the maximum CK theta resolution value cutoffs in 
   RichFunctionalCKResForRecoTracks.cpp

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r22 2010-07-20 =================

 - Change default cuts in track selector tools so they are NULL (no selection)
   All cuts are now explicitly set during configuration.
 - Update the track creator tool so when the maximum number of selected tracks
   limit is exceeded, instead of aborting the entire event straight away, try 
   selecting removing 'lesser' track types to see if this takes us below the
   limit. removal starts with Seed tracks, then VeloTT the KsTracks. If the 
   limit is still exceeded (with only long tracks) only then is the entire 
   event aborted.

! 2010-06-24 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to change in where the method that returns the S.D. of the observable 
   n-1 distribution is.
 - Add a method to the effective track refractive index tool that returns the
   standard deviation for a given track segment.

   many tracks in RichTrackCreatorFromRecoTracks
