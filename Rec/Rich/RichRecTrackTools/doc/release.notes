! Package     : Rich/RichRecTrackTools
! Responsible : Chris Jones
! Purpose     : Utility tracks tools for RICH reconstruction algorithms
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2008-10-29 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to change in ITrackCreator interface (for gcc 4.3)

! 2008-10-15 - Chris Jones
 - Downgrade Warning messages to counters

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r6 2008-09-04 ==================
! 2008-08-26 - Chris Jones
 - Don't abort processing when input Tracks are missing.

! 2008-08-15 - Chris Jones
 - Update default property values

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r5 2008-06-05 ==================
! 2008-06-05 - Chris Jones
 - Fix some unchecked StatusCodes

! 2008-06-04 - Chris Jones
 - Fixes for floating point exceptions caught using the new FPEAuditor

! 2008-06-03 - Chris Jones
 - Make 'AbortEarly = true' the default option for IsolatedTrackTool

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r4 2008-05-09 ==================
! 2008-05-09 - Chris Jones
 - Add the new track isolation tool from Susan Haines

! 2008-05-06 - Chris Jones
 - Update the state z-tolerances in DetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to allow
   running from DSTs (where only the states at the start of each RICH are 
   stored).
 - Adapt to the removal of old RichDet object locations.

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r3 2008-04-15 ==================
! 2008-03-27 - Chris Jones
 - Pre-load beam pipe objects during initialisation of track creator, if 
   needed, to avoid initialisation during first event
 - Add a debug option to track creator to only make one track per event 
   (disabled by default)

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r2 2008-02-20 ==================
! 2008-02-17 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to changes in track creator base class.

! 2008-02-15 - Chris Jones
 - Add flag to RichCherenkovAngle::avgCherenkovTheta to allow force the 
   calculation to use the the emitted photon energy spectra instead of the
   detected one (needed to prevent data race conditions where A depends on B
   but B depends on A ...).

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r1 2008-01-28 ==================
! 2008-01-25 - Chris Jones
 - Add new methods to average track signal tool.
 - Add ray tracing options to photon ray tracing geom. eff. tool.
 - Set segment average photon energy in segment creator (remove setting
   in track creator).

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r0 2007-12-11 ==================
! 2007-12-11 - Chris Jones
 - Improvements to Track segment makers

! 2007-12-05 - Chris Jones
 - Fix some doxygen comments
 - Make message about using forced inefficiency track tool a warning to
   increase visibility

! 2007-10-31 - Chris Jones
 - Split of package from RichRecTools. Original package was growing too large
   (cmt takes an eternity to build the dependencies).
  + In an attempt at some sort of organisation, this package focuses on 
    'track' tools
