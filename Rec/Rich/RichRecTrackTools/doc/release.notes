! 2010-10-15 - Chris Jones
 - Remove caching of refractive indices in CherenkovAngle tool. Doesn't 
   really save any cpu time, and breaks whenever the refractive index is
   updated on the fly.
 - Add a new method saturatedCherenkovTheta that returns the saturated CK theta
   angle for a given track segment.
 - Update the expected track signal tool to use new refractive index interface 
   method that returns the threshold momentum for a track segment, taking into
   account the radiator volumes traversed.
 - Add a scale factor job option to the expected signal tool that scales the
   threshold momentum when used to determine if a track is above or below 
   threshold. Potentially useful to allow a little leaway in the decision.

! 2010-10-14 - Chris Jones
 - Various changes to avoid loading radiator detector elements until they
   are actually needed.

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r24p1 2010-09-01 ================
! 2010-09-01 - Chris Jones
 - Fix against very rare crashed caused by an array index going out of range
   in the isolated track tool, when the photon Cherenkov phi value is 
   precisely 2.0*M_PI

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r24 2010-08-25 =================
! 2010-07-27 - Chris Jones
 - Add criteria to the Track Selectors to allow rejection of tracks with a
   failed fit status (default is enabled).

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r23 2010-07-26 =================
! 2010-07-26 - Chris Jones
 - Tighten up the maximum CK theta resolution value cutoffs in 
   RichFunctionalCKResForRecoTracks.cpp

!======================== RichRecTrackTools v1r22 2010-07-20 =================
! 2010-07-08 - Chris Jones
 - Change default cuts in track selector tools so they are NULL (no selection)
   All cuts are now explicitly set during configuration.
 - Update the track creator tool so when the maximum number of selected tracks
   limit is exceeded, instead of aborting the entire event straight away, try 
   selecting removing 'lesser' track types to see if this takes us below the
   limit. removal starts with Seed tracks, then VeloTT the KsTracks. If the 
   limit is still exceeded (with only long tracks) only then is the entire 
   event aborted.

! 2010-06-24 - Chris Jones
 - Adapt to change in where the method that returns the S.D. of the observable 
   n-1 distribution is.
 - Add a method to the effective track refractive index tool that returns the
   standard deviation for a given track segment.

   many tracks in RichTrackCreatorFromRecoTracks
