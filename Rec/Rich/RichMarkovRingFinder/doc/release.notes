   . Implemented geometric limits for RICH1 (priors still incorrect for RICH1)
   . Moved Markov-ring to track segment matching into the *Alg from the *Moni code.
   . Added a hit stripping algorithm which removes pixels from the TES if they don't
     match a Markov ring associated to a track. Track association radius and ring-pixel
     association probabilities are settable as job options.
   . Various plotting efficiency issues sorted out in the monitor algorithm.
