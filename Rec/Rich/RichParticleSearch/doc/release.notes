!========================= RichParticleSearch v1r6 2012-03-27 =========================
! 2012-03-22 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix to get run number and event number from MCHeader, not from random seeds
 - Get run number and event number once per event, rather than once per segment!
 - Fix UNINIT_CTOR defects
 - Fix unprotected debugs
 - Various minor cleanups

!========================= RichParticleSearch v1r5 2011-12-15 ================
! 2011-12-02 - Chris Jones
 - Use long long where appropriate

! 2011-09-14 - Matt Coombes
 - Removed bug from Viet Nga code causing crashes when ran over data.
 - Added Track selector in order to have cut on momentum
 - Added slot for Max/Min number of photons per track
  
! 2011-02-09 - Chris Jones
 - Use stable_sort instead of sort, to avoid reproductability problems

!========================= RichParticleSearch v1r4 2011-08-31 =========================
! 2011-06-20 - Matt Coombes
 - Added track and Evt information by Viet Nga
 
!========================= RichParticleSearch v1r3 2011-05-25 =========================
! 2011-06-09 - Matt Coombes
 - Introduced method to remove outlyer photons. Results look promising.
   better signal to background ratio.
   
! 2011-05-26 - Matt Coombes
 - Major changes to configurations. now make more sense. Set the cuts as an array in 
   form [Aerogel,R1Gas,R2Gas].
 - Removed Beta cut and replaced with maximum CK angle. Cut given in terms of standard 
   deviation. i.e number of resolutions from the saturated limit

!========================= RichParticleSearch v1r2 2011-05-25 =========================
! 2011-05-25 - Matt Coombes
 - Added functions for Yield to store track projection point
 - Cleaned code

!========================= RichParticleSearch v1r1 2011-04-27 =========================
! 2011-04-22 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove unneccessary DaVinciInterfaces include

!========================= RichParticleSearch v1r0 2011-02-28 =========================
! 2011-02-23 - Matt Coombes
 - Fixed for clean compilation
 - Removed unused Tools
 - Cleaned up imported headers
 - Removed forced Average beta < 1.0 Cut


! 2011-02-17 - Chris Jones
 - Add missing release notes.
 - Various minor fixes for clean compilation with gcc43 and icc11
 - Various minor improvements I spotted along the way.
