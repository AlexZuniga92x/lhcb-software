!============================ TrackSys v1r0 2006-01-31 ======================
! 2006-01-31 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - First version. For LHCb v19r3 and Brunel v28r2.
 - Contains a consistent set of tracking packages
   (pattern recognition packages not included - are in PatSys):
   TrackEvent, TrackFitEvent, TrackInterfaces,
   TrackExtrapolators, TrackProjectors, TrackTools, TrackMCTools,
   TrackFitter,
   TrackIdealPR, TrackMatching,
   TrackAssociators, TrackCheckers
   TrConverters, Seeding
   (these last 2 are necessary since the Seeding has not yet a version
    working with the new track event model)

 - The package also contains the following option files for Brunel v28r2:
   - $TRACKSYSROOT/options/BrunelReco.opts:
     replaces the standard Reco.opts file called in Brunel

   - $TRACKSYSROOT/options/RecoOldTracking.opts:
     runs part of the "old Track Event Model" tracking for the Seeding

   - $TRACKSYSROOT/options/RecoTracking.opts:
     runs the whole tracking: pattern recognition + fitting
     using only the "new Track Event Model"

   - $TRACKSYSROOT/options/TrackLoad.opts:
     loads all DLLs necessary for the tracking (called in RecoTracking.opts)

   - $TRACKSYSROOT/options/TrackAssociators.opts:
     runs the Track-MCParticle associator for all tracks
