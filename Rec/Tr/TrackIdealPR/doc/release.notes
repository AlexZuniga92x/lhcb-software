!======================= TrackIdealPR v1r3 2005-10-14 ========================
! 2005-10-13 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagation of changes from TrackEvent

!======================= TrackIdealPR v1r2 2005-09-21 ========================
! 2005-09-21 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrueTracksCreator renamed to IdealTracksCreator, to avoid clashes with
   same algorithm of the old track event model
 - propagation of changes from TrackInterfaces and TrackMCTools

!======================= TrackIdealPR v1r1 2005-06-24 ========================
! 2005-06-15 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagating changes from TrackEvent to TrackIdealPR
 - version of algorithm with extra debugging information
 - add use TrackMCTools to requirements file

!======================= TrackIdealPR v1r0 2005-05-24 ========================
! 2005-05-24 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagating changes from TrackEvent to TrackIdealPR
 - using now the interfaces from Tr/TrackInterfaces and no longer
   from Kernel/LHCbInterfaces

! 2005-05-13 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - correct memory leak

! 2005-05-09 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - major re-writing of the algorithm, adaptations from TrueTracksCreator
   in Tr/TrCheck

! 2005-04-15 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - using Tracks instead of FitTracks (FitTracks were removed)

! 2005-04-12 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrCheck/TrAcceptance.h tool was moved to TrackTools so that the package
   does not depend anymore on packages from the "old" track event model

! 2005-04-07 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - algorithm now outputs FitTracks of new track event model (TrackFitEvent)
 - now using the TrackTools/IStateCreator.h adapted
   from TrCheck/ITrStateCreator.h to the new track event model

!===================== TrackIdealPR v0r1 2005-04-07 =======================
! 2005-03-03 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - code clean-up

! 2005-03-02 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - adaptation to new OT event model (OTClusters -> OTTimes)
 - adaptation to new IT detector element (DeITDetector -> DeSTDetector)
 - dependance on old Checker/ITrJudge.h removed. Same functionality is given
   by TrCheck/TrAcceptance.h
 - dependance on old Checker/ITrStateCreator.h removed. Same functionality
   given by TrCheck/ITrStateCreator.h
 - the output are still TrFitTracks according to the old tracking model

! 2005-02-25 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - adaptation to GaudiAlgorithm

! 2005-02-23 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - package creation. Simple renaming of the Tr/IdealPR package of
   Rutger van der Eijk. It will be adapted to the new tracking event
   model.
