 - dependance on old Checker/ITrJudge.h removed. Same functionality is given
   by TrCheck/TrAcceptance.h
 - dependance on old Checker/ITrStateCreator.h removed. Same functionality
   given by TrCheck/ITrStateCreator.h

! 2005-02-25 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - adaptation to GaudiAlgorithm

! 2005-02-23 - Eduardo Rodrigues
