The ROOT macros in this directory are meant as examples only - some are
meant as illustrations how to operate with the NTuple, others produce more
serious work. However, all macros will need to be tailored to the use at
hand and should not be considered finished products. They're more like a
starting point so that users can obtain the tool they need more quickly
by building on work already done. Each .C file should contain a little
comment at the start, describing what it does. Also, the C++ code in
the macros should be documented to a reasonable amount so that others
can get a quick overview of the inner workings of the code with reasonably
low effort.

Most analysis macros were created with TTrees's MakeClass method,
accordingly, their use goes like this (assuming that the root session
was started in the directory in which the NTuple file resides):

	.L SomeTool.C+
	SomeTool *st = new SomeTool();
	st->Loop();
	delete st;

These macros write out a root file containing the plots.

Here comes a list with macros available so far, along with a short
description: (More detailed information should be available in the
comments at the start of each file.)

FitDblGaus		fits a double gaussian to 1D histograms, this one
			does not depend on the NTuple and may be useful
			in other situations as well

ExFitDblGaus		a simple example to show the usage of FitDblGaus
			above

HitEffPurTool		produce plots for hit efficiency, hit purity and
			ghost rates (per track type, as function of p, pt
			occupancy)
			
MomentumResolutionTool	produces plots for resolutions of different track
			parameters (per track type, at different z)
			
RecoEffTool		produces plots for reconstruction efficiency (per
			track type, as a function of p, pt, occupancy)

SlopeITOT		example: plots slope (tx) distribution of tracks
			which have hits in both IT and OT

TrackTypeTool		example: plots how many hits different track types
			leave in each subdetector

TxTool			example: plots slopes (tx) of straight lines
			connecting two OT X hits from the same track
