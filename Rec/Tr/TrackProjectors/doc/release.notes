! Package     : Tr/TrackProjectors
! Responsible : Jose Hernando, Eduardo Rodrigues
! Purpose     : Package for tracking projectors
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2006-03-08 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - update to new VeloDet path

! 2006-02-28 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrajXxxProjectors: Measurement returns a reference instead of pointer.

! 2006-02-27 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackSTProjector: stereoangle is now correctly filled.
 - Projectors now use the reference vectors from the Measurement base class.
 - Added TrajVeloRProjector and TrajVeloPhiProjector tools.
 - TrajXxxProjector: retrieve Trajectory pointer from measurement.

! 2006-02-21 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added TrajSTProjector class.
 - TrajOTProjector: Implemented correctly length of a wire.

!====================== TrackProjectors v2r0 2006-02-21 ======================
! 2006-02-21 - David Hutchcroft
 - Updated VeloPhiProjector to work with new VeloClusters

! 2006-02-20 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackOTProjector: Moved from time to distance domain.
 - TrajOTProjector: some simplifications, corrected the sign of m_H and of
   m_residual introduced by previous cvs release. Movement to distance domain
   was already made in the previous cvs release.

! 2006-02-16 - Edwin Bos
 - Moved to LHCb v20r0
 - Removed *Ray* due to introduction of Trajectories

!====================== TrackProjectors v1r5 2006-01-27 ======================
! 2006-01-17 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Fixed a bug in TrackOTProjector: Elements of the projection matrix,
   m_H[2] and m_H[3], were sometimes calculated incorrectly.

! 2006-01-17 - Edwin Bos, Jeroen van Tilburg, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - First version of the TrajOTProjector tool, an OT projector
   that uses trajectories internally instead of the standard way

! 2005-12-14 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - renamed TrackITProjector to TrackSTProjector
 - propagation of changes in Measurement classes to TrackMasterProjector

! 2005-11-29 - Edwin Bos, Jeroen van Tilburg, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - First version of the TrajOTProjector tool, an OT projector
   that uses trajectories internally instead of the standard way

!====================== TrackProjectors v1r4 2005-11-29 ======================
! 2005-11-21 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Required changes due to changes in VeloPhiMeasurement. Now using method
   resolution().

! 2005-10-28 - Jose A. Hernando
 - RayIntersector
   A class that computes the distance between two straight lines (rays)  
   and the derivation of that distance.
 - TrackOTRayProjector
   Computing the OT projection using the Ray Intersector
   (first version)

!====================== TrackProjectors v1r3 2005-10-07 ======================
! 2005-09-29 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - pow functions replaced by GSL corresponding versions
 - clean-up of unnecessary debugging

!====================== TrackProjectors v1r2 2005-07-20 ======================
! 2005-07-14 - Jose A. Hernando
 - TrackMasterProjector uses now unsigned int instead of type of measurements

!====================== TrackProjectors v1r1 2005-06-24 ======================
! 2005-06-15 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrackMasterProjector can now handle all types of measurements
 - added extra debugging information (temporarily)

!====================== TrackProjectors v1r0 2005-05-25 ======================
! 2005-05-25 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove TrackProjectors directory, move files to src
 - Add dummy implementation of TrackProjector::project() to please Windows linker

! 2005-05-24 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagating changes from TrackEvent
 - tools adapted to use interfaces from Tr/TrackInterfaces and no
   longer from Kernel/LHCbInterfaces

! 2005-04-18 - Jose Hernando, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - the main method of the projectors return a StatusCode

! 2005-04-13 - Jose Hernando, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - concrete classes TrackVeloRProjector and TrackVeloPhiProjector
   introduced and implemented

! 2005-04-12 - Jose Hernando, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - creation of the TrackMasterProjector
 - ITTrackProjector and OTTrackProjector renamed to
   TrackITProjector and TrackOTProjector, respectively

! 2005-04-08 - Jose Hernando, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - additions to base class TrackProjector
 - concrete classes ITTrackProjector and OTTrackProjector introduced
   and implemented

! 2005-03-31 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - implementation of TrackProjector.cpp

! 2005-03-10 - Jose Hernando, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - creation of the package. It will contain the tracking projectors
 - contains for now:
   - TrackProjector: base class inheriting from the pure virtual
                     interface ITrackProjector
