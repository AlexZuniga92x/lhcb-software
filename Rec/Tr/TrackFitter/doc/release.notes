!=========================== TrackFitter v2r1 2006-04-19 ====================
! 2006-04-19 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: introduced temporary vector in predict method. Needed
   since SMatrix inlines the actual calculation.

! 2006-04-18 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: use new transportIsSet method.

! 2006-04-12 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: Replace Place_at with operator equal assignment. 
 - TrackKalmanFilter: Fix the return type for TrackVectorProd method.

! 2006-04-06 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - TrackKalmanFilter: use Symmetrize function to regain a symmetric covariance
   matrix.
 - TrackKalmanFilter: get the measure error from the Node.

! 2006-03-26 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - adaptations to new SMatrix-5.10.00b and higher, and new Gaudi
 - minor bugs corrected

! 2006-03-03 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - outliers removal improved: when an outlier measurement is removed from
   the node it is also removed from the track (needed for consistency)

!=========================== TrackFitter v2r0 2006-02-13 ====================
! 2006-02-08 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - migration to LHCb v20r0
 - Geant3/Geant4 units conversions for matrix inversions done via the new
   TrackUnitsConverters.h file in TrackEvent
 - sorting of states removed as done automatically in Track class

!=========================== TrackFitter v1r1 2006-01-27 ====================
! 2006-01-20 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrackKalmanFilter: tools made private -> possible to run 2 instances
   of the fitter with, say, different projectors

! 2006-01-17 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added the required initialisation of GaudiTool in TrackMasterFitter.cpp and
   TrackKalmanFilter.cpp.
 - TrackMasterFitter.cpp: use looseTolerance to compare states at z-positions.

!=========================== TrackFitter v1r0 2005-11-28 ====================
! 2005-11-28 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - minor cosmetics

! 2005-11-21 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 Many changes. Main modifications:
 - Split the TrackKalmanFilter tool into a TrackMasterFitter tool and a
   TrackKalmanFilter tool. The latter fits a track starting from FitNodes
   (one iteration). The former takes care of outlier removal, refitting,
   states at predefined z-positions.
 - Added the FitNodes to the Track (Track still has a vector of Nodes).
 - Added Location-enum to the predefined z positions.
 - Cleaned up the debug statements.
 - Corrected bug: state at beam line was not added to the track.

! 2005-10-25 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrackEventFitter and TrackKalmanFilter cope with both upstream and
   downstream fitting (only downstream fitting possible before)
 - buglet corrected in dealing with residual errors

! 2005-10-21 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - TrackKalmanFilter: sequence filtering-smoothing fully working

! 2005-10-13 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagation of changes from TrackEvent

! 2005-09-28 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - update of measurements (so-called reference trajectories) implemented

! 2005-09-26 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - outliers removal implemented

! 2005-09-02 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - first usable version of the Kalman filter
 - version with extra debugging for tests and comparisons with old model
 - several omissions and bugs corrected

! 2005-06-29 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - KalmanFilter tool renamed to TrackKalmanFilter. And functionality added
 - Windows necessary files TrackFitter_load.cpp and TrackFitter_dll.cpp added
 - debug version of both fitting algorithm and tool

! 2005-05-27 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - first version of main algorithm for fitting all tracks added:
   adaptation from Tr/TrFitter/TrEventTracksFitter to new event model

! 2005-04-18 - Jose A. Hernando, Eduardo Rodrigues
 - Translating the Tr/TrFitter packages for the new track event model
 - original code from:
   Olivier Callot
   Matthew Needham
   Rutger van der Eijk
 - Kalman fitter and smoother tool added
