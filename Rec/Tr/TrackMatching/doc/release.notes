!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!======================= TrackMatching v2r0 2006-03-15 =======================
! 2006-03-15 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove obsolete STTools dependency

! 2006-03-02 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - adapted to new STClusterPosition interface

! 2006-02-22 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - addTTClusters method updated to work with trajectories and new STDet.

! 2006-02-09 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - migration to LHCb v20r0
   NOTE: addTTClusters method in main algorithm not completely migrated.
         It needs to be done by ST experts (old functionality gone)!
 - functor adapted to new ST detector element
 - ancestors velo and seed tracks are now set

!======================= TrackMatching v1r2 2006-01-27 =======================
! 2006-01-26 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - using the MeasurementProvider tool, needed since last changes in TrackEvent
 - added job options to be able to set input Velo and Seed tracks containers
 - minor corrections: pick up correct tool names, use GSL pow functions

! 2006-01-16 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagation of changes ITMeasurement -> STMeasurement

! 2005-12-01 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagation of changes in ITMeasurement class

!======================= TrackMatching v1r1 2005-10-10 =======================
! 2005-10-13 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - propagation of changes from TrackEvent

! 2005-10-07 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Adapt to new version of TrackKeys.h

!======================= TrackMatching v1r0 2005-09-21 ======================
! 2005-09-20 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - clean-up

! 2005-09-09 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - creation of the package. It contains the velo-seed track matching
   algorithm from Jeroen van Tilburg, adapted to the new track event model
 - it contains:
   - TrackMatchVeloSeed: the matching algorithm
   - TrackMatch.h: a class which holds the matches between the velo tracks
                   and the seed tracks
   - TTCandidate: a class which holds a set of TT clusters which can be used
                  as a candidate set of TT clusters for a matched track
   - TrackMatchingDataFunctor: helper functor used for sorting
