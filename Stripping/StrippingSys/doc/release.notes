</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r3p2>2011-05-24 StrippingSys v2r3p2 </A></H1><PRE>

Stripping for 2011 1.4 TeV processing (stripping1point4tev)
Stripping for 2010 reprocessing (stripping14)

Stripping 1.4TeV is the same as Stripping 13 except picks up new StrippingSettings.

Stripping 14 has changes in a few line builders and several cuts. It is a stripped-down version of stripping 13, with some extra post-stripping 13 lines and bugfixes.

New Package: StrippingArchive: Holds the line builders from previous strippings.
                               Starting with Stripping13 the archive will ensure
                               all future DaVinci versions can run Stripping13+
