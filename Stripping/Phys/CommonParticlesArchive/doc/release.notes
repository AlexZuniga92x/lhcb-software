!========================= CommonParticlesArchive v1r0 2014-07-28 =========================

 - First import. Provides an archive of frozen CommonParticles for each
   stripping release. Usage is simple.

     from CommonParticlesArchive import CommonParticlesArchiveConf
     CommonParticlesArchiveConf().redirect('Stripping20')

   That will redirect any future imports of CommonParticles to the Stripping20
   archive.

   The redirection must be done prior to *any* import from CommonParticles.
   The method internally first checks if a CommonParticles module has already
   been loaded, and if it has throws an exception.

   Archives for all the Stripping20rXpY releases are currently available.
   Older strippings can be added, if there is a need.
