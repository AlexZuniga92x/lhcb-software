# Config dictionaries for calibration lines (2011 restripping)
"""
Line config dictionaries for the PID and Calibration streams
(all WGs, 2011 incremental restripping).

Dictionary names should have the same name as the corresponding
StrippingSelections file containing the line builder instance.

   e.g  StrippingNoPIDDstarWithD02RSKPi linebuilder should be added as:

      StrippingNoPIDDstarWithD02RSKPi = { ... }
